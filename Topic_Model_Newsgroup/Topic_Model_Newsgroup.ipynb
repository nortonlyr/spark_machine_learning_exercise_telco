I owned a 1985 Toyota Celica\nGT.  I decided to buy myself a gift - a more exotic car.  Front runners\nincluded the Toyota Supra Turbo and the Porsche 924 (1987 model years).\nI narrowed it down to those two.  I liked the simplicity and handling\n(and snob appeal, too) of driving a Porsche.  The Supra Turbo was less\nmoney and had more features and performance - almost a personal luxury\ncar.  It had better acceleration and a higher top speed than the 924.\nI was almost ready to give in to a buying impulse for the 924, but i\ndecided to stop by my insurance agent's office on the way.  I asked\nabout what would happen to my rate with either car.\n \n\"If you buy the Supra, your rate classification will be the same as\nthe Celica (the '85 Celica was considered a subcompact and for that\nyear was rated as one of the safest cars), with a slight increase because\nthe car will be 2 years newer.  Our lower-risk division will continue\nto handle your account.\n \n\"If you buy the Porsche 924, we'll have to change you to the standard\n[higher] rate company and your rate will double.  And if you go with\na 944, it's another story again - we'll cover the rest of this year,\nbut cancel you after that.\"\n \n\"But the Supra is much faster than the 924, and the 924 is actually\nfaster than the [standard] 944.  That doens't make sense.\"\n \n That's what the book says.  We don't insure Corvettes, either.  For\nsome reason, the underwriters consider Supras - and their drivers -\nas very traditional and conservative.\"\n \nI eventually went with the Supra for a number of reasons.  The Porsche\ndealer had a nice salesman to get me interested, but a tough high-pressure\nguy in the back room.  At equal monthly payments, it would have taken\na year longer to pay for the Porsche, plus its higher insurance.  I\nconcluded that the high insurance was related to probability of auto\ntheft.\n \n   /|/| /||)|/  /~ /\\| |\\|)[~|)/~   |   Everyone's entitled to MY opinion.\n  / | |/ ||\\|\\  \\_|\\/|_|/|)[_|\\\\_|  |      goldberg@oasys.dt.navy.mil\n========Imagination is more important than knowledge. - Albert Einstein=======\n \n \n \n \n \n======================================================================== 32\n \nI live in Idaho.

(i.e. if you lift off briefly, it will remain in the\n\tlow gear.  this is handy if you are charging through corners and\n\twould like to do without the distraction of upshifts when there's\n\tanother curve approaching)\n\n3) part throttle downshifts, based on the *speed* at which the pedal is\n\tdepressed, rather than the *position* of the pedal.  modern\n\telectronics can measure this very easily and switch to sport mode.\n\tthis is wonderful if you want to charge through a green light about\n\tto turn red.  my audi senses this very well and can downshift on as\n\tlittle as half throttle if my right foot is fast enough.\n\nalso, i think that a smart automatic can deliver better gas mileage\nthan a dumb driver with a stick, all else being equal.. remember that\nthe idea of a stick being more economical than an automatic makes a\nbig assumption that the driver is smart enough to know what gear to\nuse for each situation.. how many times have you ridden with an\ninattentive driver cruising on the highway at 55/65 in 4th gear (of a\n5 speed)?  \n\nhow many % of people who drive manuals *really* know what the best\ngear to use is for every conceivable situation?  i'm sure there will\nbe some who know, but i suspect that a chip controlled automatic with\nall possible scenario/ratio combinations stored in ROM is likely to do\nbetter.  i can also say that all my previous assumptions were proved\nwrong after i got a car with instantaneous mpg readout... high gear,\nlow revs and wide open throttle is more economical than low gear, high\nrevs and small throttle opening.  the explanation is quite simple if\none sits down to think about it, but not that obvious at first sight.\n\n\neliot\n</td><td>7</td><td>rec.autos</td></tr><tr><td>From: sjp@hpuerca.atl.hp.com (Steve Phillips)\nSubject: Re: Ford and the automobile\nOrganization: Hewlett-Packard NARC Atlanta\nX-Newsreader: Tin 1.1.3 PL5\nLines: 14\n\n: Ford and his automobile.

If I were to rely on the judgement of the other car, to recognize the speed differential, I would be the stupid one.  \n\njust to satiate my curiosity, why would this make you the stupid one?  It seems\nto me, everybody SHOULD be aware enough of what is going on.  You do not need\nto calculate the future position.  You need to look at your mirrors a little\nmore.  If you glance around, you will be able to tell how much faster than you\nthe car is going.  Maybe not precisely, but well enough to know if you should\nlet him around before you try to pass.  I know what you are talking about,\nabout the other driver being startled, because i myself have been startled\nby drivers cruising by at around 90-100mph when i'm doin 55-65.  The problem,\nthough, as i saw it, was not their fault for barreling around me, but my fault\nfor not paying the attention to my task-at-hand that i should have been.\nOddly enough, since the 2nd time(happened 2x in around 4 mo. when i'd had my\nliscence for around 6 mo), i haven't been startled..and i've been passed by\ncars doing roughly twice the speed of my car.  Another odd occurance is the\nfact that this only seems to happen on LONG trips...and if i drive along with\nthem, it doesn't happen at all :-) even on the long trips! :-)  (adrenaline\nwill do that to you...i've had bad cop experiences with speeding, so anything\nover the limit is adrenalizing for me...scared i'll get caught :-)  Maybe\nthey should raise the limit, so we can pay better attention.....\n\njust curious, and my .otwo\n\nDREW\n</td><td>7</td><td>rec.autos</td></tr><tr><td>From: ciarlett@mizar.usc.edu (Joni Ciarletta)\nSubject: Master Cylinder\nOrganization: University of Southern California, Los Angeles, CA\nLines: 10\nDistribution: world\nNNTP-Posting-Host: mizar.usc.edu\n\n\nThanks to everyone who responded to my Honda Accord break question.\nIt does seem that the master cylinder is bad.

The\npull-off, which is vacuum actuated, provides a necessary pull in non-cold\nweather conditions to get the idle off the the fast idle cam. Locate the\nfast idle cam on your vehicle and see if you can rotate it to produce a\nnormal idle. If so, locate the diaphram and test it. If you can't apply\nsuction (via a good piece of rubber vacuum hose) with your mouth that will\ncause the diaphram to retract, then it's bad and should be replaced.\n\nBernie Lofaso\nApplied Research Labs\n</td><td>7</td><td>rec.autos</td></tr><tr><td>From: boyle@cactus.org (Craig Boyle)\nSubject: Re: Looking to buy Dodge Stealth, have questions\nKeywords: questions\nArticle-I.D.: cactus.1993Apr6.041810.17295\nOrganization: Capital Area Central Texas UNIX Society, Austin, Tx\nLines: 88\n\nIn article <1993Apr5.203719@usho0b.hou281.chevron.com> hhtra@usho0b.hou281.chevron.com (T.M.Haddock) writes:\n>In article <1993Apr2.030031.15691@cactus.org>, boyle@cactus.org (Craig Boyle) writes:\n>|> In article <1993Apr1.104746@usho72.hou281.chevron.com> hhtra@usho72.hou281.chevron.com (T.M.Haddock) writes:\n>\n> I found a Mopar spec sheet this weekend:\n\n>\n>               model         wgt    hp\n>             Stealth         3086   164\n>             Stealth ES      3186   222\n>             Stealth RT      3373   222\n>             Stealth RT TT   3803   300\n>\n> Okay, I'll take \"their\" word for it.\n\nThese arethe numbers I have been stating in the past 5-10 messages.

If they get caught, there is no punishment\n at all.  In the old days such behaviour would be rewarded with a whipping\n with a good-sized belt, and then taken into some hospital to see first hand\n what kind of damage such accidents cause.   Of course this doesn't happen\n any more.  That whipping would probably save the kid's life by teaching\n him some respect for others.  A person with that little respect would\n inevitably wind up dead early anyway.\n\n   The problem is creeping gradualism.  If you put a frog into hot water,\n he just jumps out.  But if you put him into cold water and then ever-so-\n gradually heat it, the frog will cook.

It should not be presumed from the existence\nof this group that it is appropriate to create many groups to cover many\ndifferent marques; groups specific to individual marques should only be\ncreated on demonstration of sufficient interest, via some avenue such as\na mailing list.\n\nrec.audio.car\n\nis not properly part of the rec.autos.* hierarchy.  it is, however,\nthe correct place for discussion of automotive audio equipment, and\nso is mentioned here.\n\nrec.autos.antique\n\nis intended for the discussion of older cars (usually more than 25 years\nold, although this is not a hard-and-fast rule.)\n\nalt.hotrod\n\nis not part of the hierarchy, but also of potential interest to the\nrec.autos reader.  it is gatewayed to the moderated hotrod mailing\nlist, and is for serious discussion of modifying and developing\nperformance vehicles.\n\nalt.autos.rod-n-custom\n\nalso not part of the `official' hierarchy; devoted to that peculiar\nAmerican hobby of customizing older cars.\n\nalt.autos.karting\n\nfor the discussion of the popular motorsport and hobby, karting.\n\nrec.autos\n\nis intended to capture discussion on all other automotive topics.\n\n\nCrossposting:\n\nCrossposting occurs when more than one newsgroup name is included on\nthe Newsgroups: line in the article header; such articles will appear\nin all of the newsgroups listed.\n\nCrossposting is one of the most misunderstood and misused facilities on\nUsenet.  You should only post to a group because you feel an article is\nappropriate; you should NEVER crosspost just to reach a particular\naudience.  This distinction is subtle, but important.  Radar Detector\narticles, for example, are more-or-less appropriate in rec.autos.  They are\nalmost never appropriate in sci.electronics or rec.ham-radio, and the fact\nthat you might want to reach the audience in sci.electronics or\nrec.ham-radio is NOT adequate justification for posting to either group.\n\nCrossposting between any or all of the rec.autos.* groups is usually\ninappropriate; if you find yourself doing so, consider whether or not it is\ntruly advisable, before sending your article.  Consider setting Followup-To:\nto point to only one newsgroup if you feel you must crosspost.\n\nCrossposting between rec.autos.* and misc.consumers is chancy at best; in\nparticular flame wars over the speed limit in the US and/or the use of\nradar detectors should NEVER be crossposted between any of these groups.\n\nMost readers of sci.electronics and rec.radio.* couldn't care less about\nthe police radar and radar detector arguments that go on endlessly in\nrec.autos.\n\nIt is an excellent idea to check the Newsgroups: and Followup-to:  lines of\narticles before posting a followup.  In particular, be wary of posting to\nmisc.test, rec.arts.startrek.*, or talk.bizarre, or any combination of these\nthree.  The life you save may be your own.\n\nDistribution:\n\nThere is a field in the header of any news article which allows you to\n(partially) control where the article goes; it is called the Distribution\nfield.  It may be very useful for many reasons; it should also serve\nas a reminder that news is a very large and widespread system.\n\nThe distribution of rec.autos.* is fairly extensive.  As of this writing, \nthe Automotive newsgroups are known to reach most of Europe, Australia,\nNew Zealand, and some locations in Japan.  With this in mind, I offer the\nfollowing hints about use of the Distribution: field in your article\nheaders, and on article content.\n\n1) Please take care not to send for-sale ads about clapped out Ford\nMavericks in New Jersey to France or California; i doubt that anyone in\neither place will care, except for my girlfriend, who for some strange\nreason likes Mavericks (but only 4-door Mavericks, at that.)\n\n2) When posting technical questions, please include the market for which\nyour car was manufactured.  For example, there are a number of differences\nbetween a European-market Ford Escort and a US-market Escort.  Likewise,\nall 1750cc and early 2000cc Alfa Romeos reached the US with Spica Fuel\ninjection; European market cars usually got carbs (often Webers).  These\ndifferences can be important to your readers; make your situation clear.\nFailure to do so can lead to pointless flame wars and a significant\nspread of misinformation.\n\n3) Be careful about your capacities and specifications when posting;\nin the US we get a mix of Metric and English system values, whereas\nEurope is almost entirely on the Metric system.  A future edition\nof this monthly posting will contain a list of commonly-used\nabbreviations that may not be known in some places that rec.autos\nreaches; this cuts both ways so let us not be parochial about it.\n\n4) Use the Distribution: field to limit where your article goes, when\npossible.  Within North America, the values na (north america), can\n(canada), and usa may be used.  in addition, the two-letter state\nabbreviations of the US are supported in some cases; e.g. if i wanted\nto send an article only to New York and New Jersey, i could put\n\"ny,nj\" in a Distribution field.  note that multiple, comma-separated\nvalues are legal.  these distribution fields vary widely, however, so\nyou should check with your local sysadmin to find out what is likely\nto be supported in your area.\n\nThe Dangers of Overgeneralization:\n\nTo amplify a warning from the distribution section of this article:\nBe wary of making foolish assumptions about all cars, tires, etc.  What is\ntrue for a 1973 Buick with a 455cid engine may be quite utterly wrong for a\n1976 Honda with a 1200cc engine.  Headlight laws in Sweden are decidedly\ndifferent from those in Idaho.\n\nThe Need for Adequate Specification:\n\nWhen you ask a question, please give a reasonable amount of information;\ne.g., if you have a question about your Honda, please specify year,\nmodel, engine size, etc.  Otherwise, most answers to your question may be\nquite useless.\n\n\nConcerning Lemons:\n\nAt one time or another, every auto manufacturer has manufactured a lemon or\ntwo; even Honda admits to this.  Please don't waste everyone's time by\nannouncing to the world that your `brand x' automobile is terrible, so all\n`brand x' automobiles are terrible, so no one should ever buy a car from\nthe `brand x' company.  Such articles are worse than useless, because they\ncause substantial wasted bandwidth while carrying little or no useful\ninformation.\n\n\nConcerning Flames:\n\nAs much as we might wish it, a flame-free newsgroup is something that most\nlikely will never occur.  Here are some guidelines for flames and how\nto deal with them (a list of flame-prone topics follows in the next section\nof this posting):\n\nIf you post something truly obnoxious and inflammatory, don't imagine for a\nminute that including the words `No Flames' will work.  It won't, and\nyou'll get exactly what you deserve.\n\nIf you're going to flame, you're more likely to get away with it if you can\ncite a fact or maybe a well-known reference.  No one is likely to believe\nbald, unsupported assertions.\n\nBe careful about who you choose to insult.  Consider not insulting anyone.\n\n\nAsking the Question:\n\nIt is a bad idea to post a question and end it with a phrase like `Please\nsend email, I don't read this group'.  It is a much better idea to\nend the question with `Please send email, if there is sufficient interest\nI'll summarize the results in a later posting.  I may miss posted responses\nto this request'.\n\nAnswering the Question:\n\nIf someone wants to hop up their Yugo, don't tell them to get a Mustang.\nEither be silent, or give them useful advice.  If someone wants advice on\ndefending a speeding ticket, don't tell them to obey the law next time --\nit's offensive, presumes guilt which is not proven, and doesn't directly\naddress the original question.  In general, don't post in order to see\nyour words in print, and don't post in order to enjoy feeling smug and\nself-righteous.\n\n\nStale and/or Inflammatory Topics:\n\nCertain topics are considered stale by `old timers'; while discussion of\nthem is certainly ok, and new, factual information is welcome, ravings\nabout them are extremely tiresome, and may get the person who posts them\nignored altogether.  Some topics are naturally inflammatory; it is\ndifficult if not impossible to have meaningful discussion of them.  Some\nof these topics include the following:\n\n1)  the 55mph speed limit in the US: Pro and Con\n\n2)  discussions about the morality and legality of the sale and usage of\n    radar detectors.\n\n3)  discussions over which radar detector is best.\n\n4)  discussions over what is a sports car (this is one reason why\n    rec.autos.sport is not a `sports car' group -- everyone would argue\n    about what constitutes a `sports car'.)\n\n5)  disputes over whether or not US Federal law protects the driver's\n    right to own and operate a radar detector\n\n6)  `Buy American' discussions\n\n7)  `clever' bumper stickers and personalized license plates\n\n8)  <insert nationality here> cars are terrible\n\n9)  What kind of car did Maxwell Smart drive?\n      [when I have a complete, accurate answer it will be added to the\n          commonly-asked questions article which is also posted monthly.\n          Until then, please don't waste bandwidth on this topic. -- rpw]\n\n\n\nPlease direct comments and suggestions about this article to:\n\n     welty@cabot.balltown.cma.com\n-- \nrichard welty        518-393-7228       welty@cabot.balltown.cma.com\n``Nothing good has ever been reported about the full rotation of\n  a race car about either its pitch or roll axis''  -- Carroll Smith\n</td><td>7</td><td>rec.autos</td></tr><tr><td>From: tcorkum@bnr.ca (Trevor Corkum)\nSubject: Is car saftey important? \nNntp-Posting-Host: 47.141.0.88\nReply-To: tcorkum@bnr.ca (Trevor Corkum)\nOrganization: Bell-Northern Research Ltd.\nLines: 11\n\n   I was recently thumbing through the 1993 Lemon-Aid New\nCar Guide.

The SAE numbers are based on a `typical'\ncurve that oils used to all have, running from (say) the viscosity of a\nroom-temperature 90-weight at 0C, down to (say) that of a room-temperature \n5-weight at 20C, for a typical 40-weight oil.\n\nOils that are designed for operation in `normal' temperatures just have\na weight specification.  Oils that are designed for operation in exceedingly\ncold temperatures have a `W' tacked on the end, so in winter in a cold\nplace, you'd stick 10W in your car in the winter and 40 in it in the summer,\nto approximate the appropriate viscosity throughout the year.\n\nModern multi-viscosity oils change viscosity much less with temperature.\nAs a result, their viscosity graphs cross over several curves.  A multi-vis\nspecification pegs the curve at two temperatures, a `normal' operating\ntemperature and a `cold' one (though I can't remember the numbers...).\n\nIn any event, the weights do indicate a significant difference.  Remember\nthat your engine is temperature-regulated (by the thermostat and\nradiator or air fins) most of the time -- unless you overheat it or\nsomething.\n\nAny weight of oil is better than no oil, or than very old, carbonized\noil.

An on-the-road rally where participants are given a set of\n      directions and clues guiding participates around the \n      Joliet/Plainfield area.  The object is to navigate a course\n      based on a set of directions and clues.  Participants will\n      be given a set of questions pertaining to the course which\n      they must answer along the way.  Points are awarded for the\n      number of correct answers given.  Directions will ultimately \n      lead to an off-road area where a four-wheel drive course is \n      set-up.  At various locations in the on-road course, check-points\n      will be set-up where participants will be asked other questions\n      or requested to perform some activity (e.g. tire roll, truck tow,\n      basketball free-throw, etc.) for additional points.\n\n   2. An optional off-road, four wheel drive course where participants\n      will navigate off-road trails, mud bogs and/or hill climbs.\n      Points are awarded for successfully navigating off-road obstacles\n      without getting stuck.  If you should get stuck (which is half\n      the fun anyway), there will be assistance to get your vehicle\n      unstuck so you can try it again.  The off-road course will\n      divided up based on tire size, so stock 4x4s as well as modified\n      4x4s can run the course.\n     \n  At the end of the rally, trophies will be awarded to top scoring\n  participants.  Door prizes and dash plaques will also be given out.\n  Food and drinks also available at the conclusion.\n\n* This is an organized activity sponsored by the Joliet Mud Turtles\n  so safety and fun is our foremost concern.  All 4x4s must be\n  street legal and have solid tow points for the off-road section\n  of the course - we don't want to have to separate someone's bumper\n  from their vehicle :) .\n\nThe Particulars:\n\n* Rally begins at Instant Replay, 2409 Plainfield Road, Joliet Il.\n    (815)436-9382   (see map below)\n* Registration is between 9 and 10:30 a.m.  First truck out at 10:00 a.m.\n* Rally date is Sunday April 25th, rain or shine\n* There is an entry fee of $10 per truck.\n* You must have a co-driver (passengers allowed)\n* A valid drivers license is required\n* Suggested equipment:\n      CB Radio\n      Compass\n      Tow Strap and Clevis\n      Clip Board and Pencil\n* No alcohol during rally\n* For more information contact\n   Gary (815)727-3415\n   Tom  (815)485-9346\n   Norm Jr. (815)741-4853\n   Brian (708)979-6083\n\n\n                                            __\n              Instant                      /\\\n      |       Replay |             |         \\\n      | 1.9mi  ___   | 1.2 mi      |        North\n      |<----->|   | <------------> |\n Rt30 |       |___|  |             |\n------|---------------------------------------------\n Exit |              |             |         ^\n 257  |              |             |         |\n      |              |             |         |\n      |Rt55          |Canton       |Larkin   |\n      |              |Farm         |Ave      |\n      |              |Rd.          |         | 3 mi.\n      |              |             |         |\n      |              |             |         |\n      |                            |         |\n      |                            |         |\n      |       Rt80                 |         v\n----------------------------------------------------\n      |                            | Exit\n      |                            | 130B\n      |                            |\n   \n</td><td>7</td><td>rec.autos</td></tr><tr><td>From: jsmith@cs.dal.ca (Jeff Smith)\nSubject: Header for 89' Honda Civic Si\nOrganization: Math, Stats & CS, Dalhousie University, Halifax, NS, Canada\nLines: 22\nNntp-Posting-Host: cs.dal.ca\n\nHello,\n\tI am looking to slightly increase the performance of my 89 Honda\nCivic Si.

Just a strut\ngoing down to a lower control arm (single bushing: not an A-arm), with a\ntension/compression rod locating it in the forward/backward direction?\n\n\tAnyway, simple strut suspensions like this can be lowered just by using\nshorter springs, cutting the springs, lowering the spring perch or shortening\nthe strut below the perch.  In each of these cases, the suspension geometry\nwill suffer because the lower control arms will not be at the\nintended angle.  A spacer placed between control arm and the bottom\nof the strut (roughly the height of the reduction) will restore\nthe suspension geometry.

I have no idea how either of my Hondas will handle at 100+ mph,\nnor do they reach 155. However, using `high' to be 70-90 mph:\n\na) They are quite amenable to long high speed drives. I've done several\n1k mile+ trips in my Civic with no problems whatsoever. The last big trip\nI made was driving from New York to Texas. I remember driving 700-800\nmiles a day at typically 75-85 mph  without any problems. I'm sure I  \nwould have been more comfortable driving a benz, but no white knuckles.\nNo problems with winds and curves. \n\nThen there was the trip back from New Orleans after Mardi Gras - where\nwe were doing 80+ all the way to Houston. No problems.\n\nb) Both my cars have surprising good fuel economy at high speeds. I see\nno difference between sustained 60 mph and sustained 80mph. On the trip\nback from New Orleans, we got about 30 mpg in my Integra, quite ok. Mind\nyou, the engine revs to almost 4k at 80. The civic is markedly better\nthan the Integra in fuel economy. 50k miles down the road, I still\nget 35 mpg at 70-75 mph driving.\n\n\n>|> b) I can't understand why these high-scale European marquees are afraid\n>|>    to design engines that can be repeatedly revved to near redline in\n>|>    the low gears.

In two weeks I will be returning to Texas (my\nhome) from my school (BYU) in Provo, Utah.  As you can imagine, trying to\ndrive nearly 1300 miles with a broken right ankle isn't just the epitome of\na good time.  My car does not have a cruise control, so I would have to do\nall the pedalling (ha ha) with my messed-up ankle.\n\nMy question:\nWhat is the general opinion of after-market cruise control units?  I\nrealize that a cheap CC (cruise control) from, say, Pep Boys, isn't going to\nbe as good as a factory or professionally installed unit (if there is such a\nthing).  And I uderstand that I probably can't expect much in the way of\naccuracy, looks and that sort of thing;  But anything's gotta be better than\ntrying to drive with a hosed ankle.\n\nI have a 1984 Jeep Cherokee, 4 speed, standard, 4*4, 2.5L engine with\nkettering(sp?) ignition (y'know, distributor cap, rotor, that set-up--not\nelectronic.  Maybe you could've guessed it being an '84, but I'm just trying\nto give information as completly as I can).\n\nI found a CC unit for 80 bucks.  It seems to use the vehicles vacuum system \ninstead of an electric servor/motor.  Is this good or bad?  If I did buy\nthis CC, which vacuum hose should I tap?\n\nIt has two speed sensors:  One magnetic, and one that gets a signal from the \nnegative side of the distributor, kinda like a tach pick-up, or so I\nunderstand.  I can use either one.  Which is best?  The manual says (I read\nit in the store today) that the magnetic/axle set-up is more accurate, but\nharder to install.  Is there really a big difference?\n\nIt has a sensor for the brake pedal, just like other CCs, but does NOT have a\nsensor for the clutch pedal.  So if I wasn't paying real close attention I\nmight push the clutch in while the cruise is trying to get the speed up.  Which\nwould wind the engine up kinda high until I got my wits about me and turned \nthe thing off.  I'm pretty coordinated, so this doesn't bother me, if it\nwere for my girlfriends car, *then* it would bother me, but I'm ok with it.\n\nThe installation also calls for an attachment to a steady-on brake signal\nand a switched-on brake signal.  I think I can get a switched brake signal\nfrom the correct side of the brake light blade fuse.  Am I right?  But I'm\nnot sure where to get the steady-on brake signal, or, for that matter, what\nexactly it is?  Any ideas as to what the manufaturer wants and where to get\nit?\n\nI think I can figure the other things out.  Like how to hook-up the negative\nside tach-type sensing gizmo and the cabin control unit, and the ground and\nall that miscellaneous business.  But I need a little help with:\n\n\t1.  Is it worth the money and safety risk (if any) for such a\n\t    device?\n\t2.  Is there any particularly good after-market CC?\n\t3.  Are \"professionally\" installed CCs signifacantly better and\n\t    worth the cabbage?\n\t4.  If the unit I saw (sorry, no manufacturer or model number, just\n\t    that it is at Pep Boy and its $80) is sufficient for my simple \n\t    needs, how do I get the thing installed properly (specifically,\n\t    the questions above)?\n\nMy father and I built a \"Veep\" (Volkswagen powered Jeep CJ-2A) when I was in\nhigh school, so I consider myself fairly good with tools, electronics, and\ncars.  So the installation doesn't scare me.  I just want to be certain that\nI get the thing installed correctly as my Cherokee is just a wee bit more\ncomplicated than my Veep. :-)\n\nI appreciate your time in reading my post, and I would appreciate any\nexpertise or opinion anybody has on the subject.  If you would like to share\nsome of your wisdom, please email as I don't get over this group very often\n(but I check my mail all the time).\n\nAgain, thanks for any help anyone may have.\n\nMike Wieda\nMikew@canc.byu.edu\n\n</td><td>7</td><td>rec.autos</td></tr><tr><td>From: hkon@athena.mit.edu (Henry Kon)\nSubject: 83 tercel sunroof leaks - arrggh\nOrganization: Massachusetts Institute of Technology\nLines: 14\nDistribution: world\nNNTP-Posting-Host: e40-008-11.mit.edu\n\nIS there a simple way tooput these sunroofs out of their misery - \ndo leaks tend to be from old gaskets ?  \nor from inadequate mechanical seals - \nor all of the above ??\n\nis there any way to halt the rain ?\n\nthanks\nhk\n--\nHenry Bruno Kon\noffice: 617-253-2781 (with machine)\nhome:   617-625-3972 (with machine)\n\n</td><td>7</td><td>rec.autos</td></tr><tr><td>From: smith@ctron.com (Lawrence C Smith)\nSubject: Re: MR2 - noisy engine.\nOrganization: Cabletron Systems, Inc.\nLines: 16\nDistribution: world\nReply-To: smith@ctron.com\nNNTP-Posting-Host: glinda.ctron.com\n\nIn article <Apr21.053718.19765@engr.washington.edu>, eliot@lanmola.engr.washington.edu (eliot) writes:\n\n>if the noise really bugs you, there is nothing else that you can do\n>except to sell it and get a V6.\n\nPerhaps a nice used '88 Pontiac Fiero GT?  2.8 liters.\n\nDoes anyone know if the motor mounts for the 2.8 and the twin-dual-cam 3.4\nliter match?

My 1975 Saab 99\ndidn't have them, but a friend's 1978 Saab 99 certainly did.  In addition\nto the confentional tail-light mounted backup lights, they had another\nset integrated into the front turn signal assembly.  For those of you who\ndon't remember, Saabs of that vintage had an enormous multicoloured plastic\ngrowth, about the size of a _National Geographic_ magazine, sticking out\nof the front fender, which incorporated amber \"parking lights\", amber side\nmarker lights/reflectors, white \"cornering lamps\" (like American luxury\ncars) aimed towards the side of the road when you have your turn indicators\non, and white \"backup lights\" aimed towards the back of the car when you\nhave selected reverse gear.  The glossy brochure showed how these front\nmounted backup lights were useful for illuminating hazards (pot holes, kid's\ntoys, etc) that would be run over by the front of the car if you had the\nwheels turned while backing up.\n\nMart L.

The problem is that the car has \naftermarket tint on all windows except the windshield. The tint is rather\nweak, and you can clearly see the inside of the car through the tint.\n\nThe inspection garage said that they won't pass it unless I get a\nwaiver from the state police. So I went to the state police - the\nofficer told me that aftermarket tint is illegal, and I can get a\nwaiver only for a pre-84 car or for a medical reason. I asked him to\nshow me the section of the vehicle code that says it's illegal.  He\nshowed it to me and the paraghaph said that you can't have tint, if\nyou can't see the inside of the car because of the tint. When I told\nhim that you can in fact see the inside very well, he shut the book\nand said \"It's just illegal, and in fact we can have someone give you\na ticket for it right now.\" Well, won't argue with that...\n\nSince the vehicle code says it's OK as long as you can see through the\ntint, I'd like to keep it (I'll re-read the vehicle code in the\nlibrary).  I'd also like to get some sort of paper from the police\nthat says it's OK, so I can get the inspection, and so that I won't\nget in trouble for the tint later on. I also wouldn't mind registering\na complaint against that officer - he really pissed me off.\n\nSo does anyone have any experience getting that sort of a paper from\nthe police, especially in Pennsylvania? Does anyone have any experience\nregistering a complaint against an officer? I called the station \nlater on today, but they basically said there is no place where I\ncould register a complaint against an officer... And if I do decide\nto keep the tint and get a ticket anyway, how much of a chance do\nI stand to succesfully appeal the ticket in court?\n\nAny comments about it will be welcome!\n\nMichal\n\n</td><td>7</td><td>rec.autos</td></tr><tr><td>From: marshatt@feserve.cc.purdue.edu (Zauberer)\nSubject: Re: WARNING.....(please read)...\nOrganization: Purdue University\n \n Can we please stick to AUTOMOTIVE topics .

I don't care if there are going to\nreform their dealers/service with the intro of the LH cars, I will believe\nit when I see it.  Case and point, the local dodge dealer.  You drive up,\njust looking, you don't even get out of your door, when about 10 (yes 10)\nsalesman all eye you like their next meal, and literally pounce on you,\nand try to get you to make a deal, on everything your eye wanders towards.\nService is about 2 times worse than that.  I had an alignment problem, but\nthey tried to tell me that the K frame was bent, and about 2000 dollars of\nwork/parts to fix it.  Let me tell you the problems I had, and I took care\nof this car, I put alot of miles on it in the first couple years, but took\nit to every checkup it needed, and many that shouldn't have been.\n\n1988 Dodge Shadow ES\n\nThese were replaced within the 4 years that I owned the car.\n\nEngine \n4 Alternators\nRear Suspension Torsion Bar\n2 Water pumps\n5 thermostats\nHall effect sensor\nMain computer\n4 Batteries\n\nThese were rebuilt/repaired\n\nRadiator\nAutomatic Transmission\nPower Steering\n\n\nThose are just the things I can remember off the top of my head.  For\nabout a year before I sold the car, I said to myself, it's a good car, I\njust can't find anybody competent enough the fix it.  In the end, before I\ntraded it in for a Saturn, the power steering started acting up again.  I\njust stopped putting money into it.  I must have put at least $5000-$7000\nworth of repairs over it's lifetime.  I am sorry but Lee Iacocca can bite\nme.  Bullshit, whoever backs em best, is just afraid the stupid things are\ngoing to fall apart, and no one will buy them without assurance, why the\nhell do you think that LH has been nicknamed Last Hope.\n\nYou can do better, and I know people will disagree with me here, but\nJapanese, like Honda, or Toyota, or the only american car company that I\nfeel is a quality product, Saturn.  I will not touch another chrysler\nproduct again, no way.  I don't care how good the LH cars look good, and I\nwill admit they look promising, but not with the support that you get.  GM\nisn't much better, thank god, they don't control Saturn, like they do\ntheir divisions, or it would be just another marketing ploy.  \n\nDon't get me wrong, i will be watching my car (which I do like) like a\nhawk for the next 4 years.  I am much more hesitant to say it (or any) car\nis really good, until it has proved itself to me.\n\nBut since someone else pointed out C&D as a source.  I will note, because\nI used to read these magazines, that Car and Driver has never had a good\nthing to say about most Chrysler products (Shadow for one), always were\nthey moaning about the reguritated K-car, and engine.  Whereas Motor Trend\nalways thought they were great cars.  No car magazine is really objective.\n\nAnd although there are alot of people who don't like Consumers Reports, I\nwill use them to reinforce my argument (I already know about the big stink\nwith the Saturn crash tests, time will tell how good a car they are), the\nshadow/sundance rate much worse than average, in fact none of the\nchrysler's rate a better than average, I think the best one is just\naverage.  Excluding the diamond star/mitsubishi stuff and the LH's.  You\ncan find bad stuff about the Shadow.  Try as I might, when I researched\nthe Saturn, I could not find anything bad about it.  There is a great deal\nof information about this company, just because it is a new american\ncompany and it has created quite a stir in the automotive community, for\ngood reason.  Much more than the introduction of any new model lines of\nany established company.  I read an article, which had a sub-column, an I\nthink this imprinted on me more than anything else.  Some big wig in\nToyota said and I quote, \"We are watching them very closely.\"  Come on,\neverybody grow up, the foreign cars, especially the japanese have been\nkicking our butts, for good reason, the american car companies could not make\na good product or support the customer the way they want these days, to\nset in their ways, which is one of the reasons Saturn was created.  They\nare still struggling because they haven't learned yet.  They have the\nability, the workers are not inferior, the technology is not out of date,\nbut their attitude is, and they are just finding this out.

Your problem in the wet is call hydroplaning.\nYou may not have enough tread left to channel water out from under the\ntire - so it goes fishy on you as it lifts off the road.\n\n(2) Tires age. In particular, soft tire compounds get harder as you put\nthem thru more heat cycles. Harder compounds don't grip as well as\nsoft ones.

You can get into a 3.0 L v-6 (141 hp) Shadow for $10~11K (the I-4  \nturbo a bit more), and a droptop for $14~15K.  \n\n\n</td><td>7</td><td>rec.autos</td></tr><tr><td>From: kensib@cary112.its.rpi.edu (Brian C.

It's only been in the last\nyear or two that airbags have become a significant selling feature.\nVW assumed that  automatic belts would satisfy govt. requirements for\npassive restraint, but didn't guess that the 'merican consumer would\nactually make buy decisions based on the presence of an airbag.\n\nVW is really hurting right now in the US market.

As per normal VW practice, the US\nlaunch of the Jetta III is delayed again and again, until a good chunk\nof the useful life of the design is spent.\n\nI think that Passats come from Germany, so there is not the same\nquality and availability issue.

A good used car buy.\nThe MX-6 was almost there but rolled more than I liked.  \nI didn't like the Prelude dash/instrumentation at all.  Too weird for me.\nThe MR2 has a much smaller non-passenger space than I needed, so out that went.\nThe Celica was \"ok\" but underpowered when loaded with options (and somewhat\noverpriced too) in non-turbo form.\nI never considered the 240SX since it didn't have an airbag.  I did look at it\nfor its RWD virtues but that's it.  The Corolla never entered my mind.\nI should have looked at the Mitsubishi VR4/Dodge Stealth more.\nSince my list was exhausted, I bought the Probe.  :-)\n\nThe car design is different than earlier years, so it's too early to see its\nreliability so far.  For what it's worth, my comments:\n\nMy dislikes:\nShutting door with windows up from inside rarely makes good wind seal.\nHeadlights have \"stuck\" up a few times (weather?)\nair conditioning broke ~4000 miles (pressure cycling switch)\ncondensation around rear washer fluid container doesn't drain completely.\ncrammed engine; little hope for do-it-yourselfers (typical)\nparts somewhat more expensive than normal Ford parts\nunderside plastic doesn't like sharp driveways and speedbumps (typical).\nassembly gripes: tape on radiator, screw fell out of dash, seat seams not \nstitched properly.  Hopefully just a fluke.\nFord only gives 1 key with the car.  C'mon Ford, spend an extra few pennies!\nRear hatch has no padding on corners when up.  I'm waiting for the day when\nI bash my head on the corner.\nhorn buttons behind air bag in spokes and not in center (personal preference)\nTires fling dirt/mud onto side of car \n\nMy Likes:\nengine (design/valves/sounds/smoothness/power/mileage/torque) -- definitely #1\nhandling (very good for FWD; understeer only at limits)\ntransmission (the 5 speed is a must)\nusable instrumentation (lovely readable analog everywhere)\nVery little torque steer at full power (much better than the '90 SHO I drive)\nstability at 100+mph (high gearing though)\nlow cowl (good visibility in front)\nHeated outside mirrors (nice in fog, never tested in freezing weather)\nABS/Air bag (see above)\nrear seats fold down (I have few rear seat passengers so a trunk not important)\nNo shake/rattle noises when going over bumps/potholes (still!)\nTires: 225/55VR16 Goodyear Eagles (70% left; hoping for 30K :-)\n\nAs you can see, I'm primarily interested in the engine.  While it doesn't\nhave the uummmph of a big-liter car or the turbo rush, the big selling\npoint for me was the all-aluminum 24 value 2.5 liter engine.  \n\nThe overall car is a good buy for the money.  That market segment hasn't changed\nmuch since July (Prelude VTEC, Honda Del Sol??).  I drive it to and from work\neach day on relatively smooth roads, and most noticable thing is that the\nProbe's suspension doesn't like potholes.  When you test drive one, find a \npotholed road somewhere around town and see if the jarring you get is tolerable.\nIf you have 3+ passengers, by all means bring them along too.  They'll find\nthat they have no room in the back and you'll find that the car rides\ndifferently (if that's \"better\" is up to you).  Also, there's a lot of glass\naround you which I wasn't expecting; the temperature inside the car gets pretty\nhot in the summer.  My back seat passengers (now very few) complain about\nthe lack of ventilation; you may want to consider that when combined with\nthe heat.  I've heard that the exhaust system has trouble, but mine works fine.\nLeather and the keyless entry system weren't available when I got the car so\nI can't comment on them (I got the car before it was officially announced).  \nI prefer cloth to leather anyway.  \n\nI wouldn't want this car in the snow:  The suspension is too rough for the\ninevitable surprise potholes, tires aren't meant for snow, and the seats assume\nthat you're not wearing lots of thick clothing.  Rain is much better:  water \ngenerally beads off the windshield at freeway speed, the windshield wiper\ncontrols are easy and understandable, and I barely hydroplaned once with the\nEagles (and I was really trying).  \nThere is also a definite lack of cup holder/small storage places.  The GT\nhas map holders below the speakers in the door, but they're rigid plastic\nthat could fit two cassettes or CD's max.

But the demonstration of this\nproduct really impressive, if it didn't cheat.\n\nThe setup of the demo is fairly simple. A cone shaped rotor is\nhalf submerged in a small oil sink, filled with motor oil. The rotor\nis powered by an electronic motor. A metal pad is pressed against\nthe rotor using the torque wrench until the rotor stopped by friction. \nThe torque that is needed to stop rotor is read from the torque wrench.\n\nBefore MILITECH was added, the rotor was stopped with about 60 lb-ft\nof torque (You pick the brand of oil, no difference). Once MILITECH was \nadded to the oil, the rotor could not be stopped even with 120+ lb-ft of\ntorque. \n\nHere is the good part: even after the salesman emptied the oil sink, \nyou still could not stopped the rotor with the thin film remained  on it.\n\nThey say you need only add 2oz per quart of oil every 15k miles. A 16 oz\nbottle is $25.\n\nI still have my doubts. If this product is really so great, why it was\nso little known? The salesman said it is widely used in military. I didn't\nbelieve it.  The demo was so impressive, that I bought a bottle against\nmy common sense.\n\nHas anyone heard of or actually used this product? Is it real?\nIf you are going to the auto show, please visit this stand on the \nsecond floor. See if can find out if the demo is a hoax or not.\n\nJason Chen\n\n</td><td>7</td><td>rec.autos</td></tr><tr><td>From: rmt6r@faraday.clas.Virginia.EDU (Roy Matthew Thigpen)\nSubject: (w)rec.autos\nOrganization: University of Virginia\nLines: 3\n\n\nThere is just something disconcerting about the name of this group. :)\n\n</td><td>7</td><td>rec.autos</td></tr><tr><td>From: mcostell@oasys.dt.navy.mil (Malcolm G.

New York prohibits their use in\n    large trucks.  In Canada, they are illegal in Manitoba, Ontario,\n    Quebec, Newfoundland and PEI (Prince Edward Island).  They\n    are apparently are illegal through most, if not all, of Europe.\n    Legislation which would make them illegal is pending in many other\n    jurisdictions; chances of such legislation passing varies a great deal.\n\nQ:  Where are Radar Detector Detectors used?  Do they really work?\n\nA:  Usage is spreading rapidly; initially they were used only in Canada,\n    but now they are appearing in New York and Virginia.  It is unsafe\n    to assume that they are not in use in Connecticut and D.C.\n    They work by detecting a certain frequency radiated by many currently\n    available super Het radar detectors; some brands of detector radiate\n    more strongly than others, and are thus more likely to be spotted.\n    New radar detectors are becoming available which may not be detected\n    by the current generation of detector detectors.  Note that a\n    detector may only be spotted by one of these devices if it is turned\n    on.\n\nQ:  What is VASCAR?  Is it some kind of Radar?\n\nA:  VASCAR is nothing more than a fancy stopwatch and time-speed-distance\n    computer.  It depends on the operator pressing buttons as the target\n    vehicle passes landmarks.  No radar signals are emitted by a VASCAR\n    system.\n\nQ:  What is Ka band radar?  Where is it used?  Should a radar detector be\n    able to handle it? \n\nA:  Ka band has recently been made available by the FCC for use in the US\n    in so-called photo-radar installations.  In these installations, a\n    low-powered beam is aimed across the road at a 45 degree angle to the\n    direction of traffic, and a picture is taken of vehicles which the\n    radar unit determines to have been in violation of the speed limit.\n    Tickets are mailed to the owner of the vehicle.  Because of the low\n    power and the 45 degree angle, many people believe that a radar\n    detector cannot give reasonable warning of a Ka band radar unit,\n    although some manufacturers of radar detectors have added such\n    capability anyway.  The number of locales where photo-radar is in use\n    is limited, and some question the legality of such units.  Best advice:\n    learn what photo radar units look like, and keep track of where they\n    are used (or else, don't speed.)\n\nQ:  Do radar jammers work?  Are they legal?\n\nA:  Quick answer:  No, and Not in the USA.\n    Detailed answer:  Cheap radar jammers do not work well at all.\n    Jammers that work are expensive and usually the property of the\n    military.  Jammers are a major violation of the regulations of the\n    Federal Communications Commission of the USA.\n\nDriving technique and Vehicle Dynamics Questions:\n\nQ:  What are understeer and oversteer?\n\nA:  Understeer and oversteer are terms describing the behaviour of a\n    car while cornering near the `limit' (limit of adhesion, that is.)\n    Most drivers do not normally drive hard enough for these terms to\n    be descriptive of the situations they encounter.  Simply put, they\n    tell whether the car wants to go straight in a corner (steer `less',\n    or `understeer') or it wants to turn more in a corner (`oversteer'.)\n    Understeer is commonly designed into most production cars so that\n    untrained drivers, inadvertantly traveling too fast, won't get into\n    trouble.  Understeer may also be induced by using too much throttle\n    in a corner.  Oversteer is designed into some more performance\n    oriented cars; it may be induced by lifting on the throttle (Trailing\n    throttle oversteer, or TTO).  In extreme cases, lifting on the throttle\n    may induce so much oversteer that the car reacts by fishtailing or\n    spinning.\n\n    Some technical details:  in a corner at speed, the tires on the car\n    will develop what are called `slip angles'; the slip angle is the\n    angular difference between the direction that the car is traveling\n    and the direction that the steering wheel is directing the car to\n    travel.  In understeer, the front wheels have a greater slip angle\n    than the rear wheels.  In oversteer, the rear wheels have a greater\n    slip angle than the front wheels.\n\nQ: What is a rev-matched downshift?\n\nA: When downshifting, the engine must be rotating faster in the lower gear\n   than it was in the higher gear.  However, during a downshift, normally\n   you declutch and lift your foot from the throttle, so the revs drop\n   rather than increase.  In rev-matched downshift, you blip the throttle\n   before re-engaging the clutch so that the engine will already be up to\n   the new speed.  This results in a much smoother and faster downshift.\n\nQ: What does heel-and-toe mean?\n\nA: Heel-and-toe is a technique used to do a rev-matched downshift while\n   braking.  This is normally challenging, because you need the right foot\n   for both the brake and throttle.  It is called heel-and-toe because you\n   use one end of the foot on the brake, and the other on the throttle to\n   match revs for the downshift.  In many modern cars this is a misnomer;\n   often you must use the ball of the foot on the brake and the right side\n   on the throttle.\n\n   Note that some race car drivers will skip the clutch, and just use the\n   left foot on the brake and the right foot on the throttle, accomplishing\n   the same thing.\n\nQ: What is double-clutch downshifting?\n\nA: While your right foot is doing the above, your left foot can do one of\n   three things:  nothing, declutch once, or declutch twice.  The reason for\n   declutching twice is to match the speeds of the two shafts in the\n   transmission to the speed of the engine.  This is usually coupled with\n   rev-matching, so that while the engine is in neutral and the clutch\n   engaged, the throttle is blipped and both shafts of the transmission\n   speed up.\n\n   The procedure is as follows:\n   (0) declutch\n   (1) move gearshift lever to neutral\n   (2) engage clutch\n   (3) match revs\n   (4) declutch\n   (5) move gearshift lever to next lower gear\n   (6) engage clutch\n\n   This sounds like a lot of work, but with practice it becomes natural.\n   The problem that double-clutching solves is normally the function of the\n   synchronizers within the gearbox.  In transmissions without synchros or\n   with very worn synchros, double-clutching makes it much easier to shift.\n   Basically, if you double-clutch well, you are not using the synchros at\n   all.  This is generally unnecessary on street cars with synchros in good\n   condition.\n\nQ: What do the numbers for acceleration from 0-60, 1/4 mile, skidpad, and\n   slalom times in the Auto Magazines really mean?  May they be compared?\n\nA: In short, 1) not as much as the magazines want you to believe, and\n   2) almost never.\n\n   In more detail:  the acceleration numbers (0-60mph and 1/4 mile times\n   in the US) may be vaguely compared as long as they all come from the\n   same source.  Testing procedures vary so much from magazine to magazine\n   that comparing a Road & Track number to a Car & Driver number is quite\n   pointless.  Keep in mind, too, that the same variation applies from\n   driver to driver on the street; the driver is a major (often *the*\n   major) part of the equation.\n\n   Skidpads vary, and even if they didn't, skidpad figures are really\n   only tests of the stickiness of the stock tires; they change radically\n   when tire compounds change.  DO NOT make any assumptions about the\n   comparative handling of, say, two sports sedans based on skidpad numbers.\n   This is not to suggest that skidpads are without value, however. Skidpads\n   are an excellent educational tool at driving schools.  They are simply\n   of limited value in the comparison of anything except tires.\n\n   Slalom times are slightly more useful; they test some small parts of the\n   automobile's transient response.  However, they are also heavily influenced\n   by the stock rubber on the car, and they do not test many corners of the\n   car's envelope.  They DO NOT tell you all you need to know before making\n   a buying decision.  For example, they don't tell you what the rear end\n   of the car will do on a road which suddenly goes off-camber.  When a car\n   has an adjustable suspension, these tests are usually done in the `sport'\n   setting, which may be quite unsuitable for daily driving.  The list of\n   caveats could go on for page after page.\n\nQ: My buddy claims that wide tires don't make any difference, according\n   to his freshman physics textbook, and that you can't ever accelerate\n   or corner at more than 1.0G.  Does he know what he's talking about?\n\nA: 1) in short:  he hasn't got a clue.\n\n   2) in more detail: the equations for friction used in freshman physics\n   textbooks presume that the surfaces are smooth,  dry and non-deformable,\n   none of which properly apply to tire traction except in the case of a\n   stone cold tire on dry pavement which is far below its proper operating\n   temperature.\n\n   Pavement is _never_ smooth; it is always irregular to a greater or lesser\n   extent.  Tires, which are not really dry and solid (as rubber is a\n   substance which in its natural form is liquid, and which has only been\n   coerced into a semblance of solidity by chemical magic), deform to match\n   the surface of the pavement which a vehicle is traveling over.  In a tire\n   at operating temperature, grip is actually generated by shear stresses\n   inside the deformed rubber, and not by anything even remotely resembling\n   friction in the freshman physics sense of the term.  The colder a tire\n   is relative to its operating temperature, the closer its behaviour will\n   be to the traditional concept of friction; if much hotter than the its\n   proper operating temperature, the more likely the possibility of some\n   part of the tire actually ``reverting'' to liquid, which is mostly like\n   to happen deep in the tread, causing characteristic blisters and chunking.\n   (This latter, though, is almost completely unlikely to happen in normal\n   street driving, so unless you're a competition driver or do a lot of\n   high speed track driving, don't worry about it.)\n\n   Because tire traction is completely out of the domain of simple friction,\n   it does not obey the freshman physics equation at all; thus dragsters\n   accelerate at more than 1.0G and race cars corner and brake at more than\n   1.0G.  Because simple friction does not apply, it is actually possible\n   for different sized contact patches to generate differing amounts of\n   grip.  An actual analysis of tire behavior would require techniques\n   such as Finite Element Analysis, due to the complexity of the mechanism.\n\nMisc.

In particular, NEVER\n    ask in rec.humor if you want a useful result.\n\n    Saab:   Svenska Aeroplan A.

Porsche has extensive business dealings with VW/Audi,\n    which causes some confusion.  Since currently Porsche is in some\n    financial difficulty, there is a possibility that Mercedes or VW may\n    be interested in purchasing the company in the near future, but this\n    is only speculation at this time.\n-- \nrichard welty        518-393-7228       welty@cabot.balltown.cma.com\n``Nothing good has ever been reported about the full rotation of\n  a race car about either its pitch or roll axis''  -- Carroll Smith\n</td><td>7</td><td>rec.autos</td></tr><tr><td>From: mcostell@oasys.dt.navy.mil (Malcolm G.

I've been\ndoing it my self over 200,000 miles, on my current toyota truck I've got\nover 150k. I've heard people talk about how doing this can damage a\ntransmission. My experiences suggest otherwise. What techniques do you use?\n\nOn some old pieces of junk I drove, the transmission was so\nworn that pumping the clutch was the only way to shift, except clutchless.\nTo date I've driven rabbits, datsuns, comets, fords & a chevy. Some where\nharder than others to shift but generally the higher the milage the smoother\nquicker & easier they where to shift.\n\nMy technique is to ease back off the throttle and at the same time gently\nwrist back on the shift lever. If for some reason I miss the shift window,\nI lightly press the accelerator & try agian. I've found that clutchless\nshifting is eaiser/quicker at high rpms (4000-7000). I also skip gears some\ntimes using 1-3-5 ,1-2-4-5. \n\nkrispy\n</td><td>7</td><td>rec.autos</td></tr><tr><td>From: hhm@cbnewsd.cb.att.com (herschel.h.mayo)\nSubject: Re: BRAINDEAD Drivers Who Don't Look Ahead--\nOrganization: Chicago Home for the Morally Challenged\nDistribution: usa\nKeywords: bad drivers\nLines: 27\n\n\n> I agree that if traffic is all blocked up and you want to pass, you might\n> not feel like moving over for someone behind you because you don't want to\n> give them that one car-length, when they should just wait like you are.\n> BUT, if you're one of those people that just sit's behind the person, and\n> doesn't flash them with the high beams, or pull left and flash them, or\n> ride their bumper, or otherwise tell them that you *do* in fact want to \n> go by, and you're not just drafting them, then get the hell out of the \n> way of someone who will!

In the early 80's with the\nfuel crisis, etc., everyone wanted better fuel mileage.  Diesel fuel\nwas the cheapest fuel available and usually provides better mileage\nthan comparable gasoline engines.  So, GM decided to conver their\n350 gas engine into a diesel engine (I think was a 5.7 liter).  Big\nmistake.  The engine was not redesigned, but converted.  The engine\ncould not handle the higher compression, etc.  Lots of problems with\nthese cars.  This thew up a big red flag to the casual observer --\nDON\"T BUY A DIESEL.  THEY ARE BAD.  This was a gross generalization.\n\nAsk yourself this question -- if your livelihood depended on driving,\nLOTS of it, would you use a dependable or undependable (but cheaper\nin the short run) vehicle?  What do Greyhound busses have in them?\nTrailer Trucks?  Even Train Locomotives?  Are these gasoline engines?\nNo, they are diesel.  Tractor trailer truck manufacturers provide a\n500,000 mile warrantee with they vehicles.\n\nI own an `82 Diesel Suburban.  The 6.2L diesel is a GREAT engine.\nJust keeps going.  It was more expensive (when new) than the gasoline\nengine vehicle was.  The only problem with diesel engines is that \nwhen they need to be rebuilt, they are expensive.  In a gas 350\nengine, you will pay about $1000 for a rebuild.  Diesel 6.2L is about\n$2000.  But then again, the diesel engine lasts about twice as long\nand gets about 50% better mileage.  A carburator for a gasoline engine\ncosts about $100 to rebuild (or less).  A rebuild of the fuel injection\npump on a diesel will cost about $500 (or more).  But then again,\nyou never need a tune-up.\n\nIf you're looking at a rebuilt 6.2L, I'd say you got a great deal.\nCheck to see if the fuel injection pump was rebuilt also.\n\nGood luck.\n</td><td>7</td><td>rec.autos</td></tr><tr><td>From: rhorwell@crab.atc.boeing.com (Roland Faragher-Horwell,crab)\nSubject: Re: What is \" Volvo \" ?\nReply-To: rhorwell@atc.boeing.com\nOrganization: Boeing Computer Services\nLines: 46\n\nIn article 21071@sernews.raleigh.ibm.com, mperry@vnet.ibm.com (Mark Perry) writes:\n>>Hardly a good reason, most US cars do too - and plenty of people\n>>buy them (in the US anyway :-).

(was Re: Too fast)\nOrganization: Purdue University\nDistribution: usa\nLines: 28\n\n Remember roads in America are NOT designed for speeds above 80 meaning they\nwould be safe at 55-65. Roads like the Autobahn are smoother, straiter,\nwider and slightly banked. \n\nExample: A few months back I was traveling late at  night ( 3:00 am or so)\nand I was changing highways at a bent crosssing. It  curved off to the south\neast becoming hidden by trees after about 1,000 ft and continued to the\nleft strait north. I wanted to turn north, checked the south lane, rolled\ninto the crossing and checked the north lane. Nevertheless there wasn't \na car in sight, so I took one last look and pulled into the left hand lane.\nNow my car isn't a 5 sec 0-60 performer but I was in the corect lane and \nover 40 in decent time, even at 3:00 I wasn't wasting time. It was then\nthat I checked my mirror and saw a Mustang closing in my lane *FAST*, he \nhad just turned the corner and was just noticing me. Luckly he saw me and \nchanged lanes in time, I estamate he was moving in excess of 90 or so.\nI was just a by stander, I had no chance of runing from him, or moving out \nof his way. I'm glad he saw my brake lights in time. I shudder to \nthink of what would have happened had I wainted to pull out and not \nleft the time he needed to dodge me.\n\nRule: Just because your car can do 100+, and  your way is clear,\ndon't assume it will stay that way.\n\n      ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n      TRAVIS disclamer: the ideas expressed above are in fact the same as \n                        my employer, since I have none |-)\n           e-mail, flame, at : marshatt@feserve.cc.purdue.edu\n      ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n</td><td>7</td><td>rec.autos</td></tr><tr><td>From: mps1@cec1.wustl.edu (Mihir Pramod Shah)\nSubject: Re: new saturn argument\nArticle-I.D.: wuecl.1993Apr6.225025.13054\nOrganization: Washington University, St. Louis MO\nLines: 78\nNntp-Posting-Host: cec1\n\nIn article <C50p1M.21o@noose.ecn.purdue.edu> rjwade@rainbow.ecn.purdue.edu (Robert J.

Most of the other\nmodels are in the same class, but aren't the first cars you would think of.\nI threw in the Escort/Tracer because it has a good amount of Japanese\ntechnology and has similar reliability stats.  I didn't include domestic small\ncars such as the Cavalier, Sunbird, Shadow, Sundance, Tempo, and Topaz, since I\nthink Saturn is going after cars that have at least some degree of Japanese\nroots.\n\nThe SC1/SC2 was meant to compete against the following cars:\n\nToyota Paseo\nHonda Civic Si/Civic Coupes/del Sol Si\nNissan NX1600/NX2000\nMazda MX-3\nIsuzu Impulse\nGeo Storm\nFord Escort GT\n\n\nIf you look at the prices of these cars, they're more expensive than they're\n4-door counterparts.  The is good reason for this.  It is a more upscale and\ntrend-driven market.  Even though many of these models are based on sedan\nplatforms, their interior, etc. is good enough to warrant slightly higher\nprices.  Here are some of the platform derivations I can think of:\n\nTercel -> Paseo\nSentra -> NX1600/NX2000\nCivic -> del Sol\n323 -> MX-3 (not sure on this one)\nStylus -> Impulse/Storm\n\nTo illustrate, a Tercel starts at around $8000, while the Paseo starts at\naround $11,000.  Even a 4-door Tercel will cost less than a 2-door Paseo.  Now,\nyou might be saying that the Tercel doesn't offer the power that some 4-doors\noffer.  What I mean is that there is no 4-dr Tercel with a comparable\npowerplant as its sport coupe derivative.  Let's take another example: the\nIsuzu Stylus XS and Impulse XS/Storm GSi.  Both have the same powerplants (a\n1.6L 140hp engine), but the smaller 2-dr coupes are generally more expensive.\nAgain, this is because the two-door sport coupe market is a more\nfashion-oriented and trend-setting segment.  People are willing to pay more\nmoney for this type of car.  \n\n\nIn short, even though the SC1/SC2 may be smaller, hence \"less\" car, it's market\norientation dictates a slightly higher price than its mechanically equivalent\nsedan (SL1/SL2) version.\n\nI hope this clears things up a bit......\n\n\nMihir Shah\n\t \n</td><td>7</td><td>rec.autos</td></tr><tr><td>From: aep@world.std.com (Andrew E Page)\nSubject: Re: Importing Volvo?\nOrganization: The World Public Access UNIX, Brookline, MA\nLines: 9\n\n\n   There was an article in Business week not more the 4 weeks ago\non this very subject.

This article\nwill provide the essential information for doing so on standard\nUnix systems.  A shell script and examples of alias file setups\nare included which presently run on a Sparc 2 here at balltown.cma.com\nfor a number of mailing lists.  Note that if you do set up an automotive\nmailing list, please let me know of the -request address so that I can\nlist it in the montly rec.autos posting.  Also inform the keeper of the\nUsenet list-of-lists (check news.answers for this monthly posting.)\n\nFirst of all, to get anywhere, you need to either 1) be a sysadmin,\nor 2) have some measure of assistance from your sysadmin.  It is also\nimportant that you have reasonably good network connectivity; if it seems\nlike you get everything several days after anyone else, or that you\nhave trouble getting email through, then your network connectivity is\nprobably not good enough.\n\nListserv:\n\nThere is a handy automated mailing list package named listserv, which\nis available from several ftp servers on the network.  Details of\nthe installation and operation of listserv are beyond the scope of this\narticle, but anyone who is considering running a large mailing list should\nprobably  look at listserv carefully.\n\nThe Alias file:\n\nOn a typical unix system; there is a file named /usr/lib/aliases on\nwhichever file server is your mail host; it contains lines such as:\n\nfoo:   bar, baz, bletch\n\n\nwhich means that any email sent the name `foo' on that host is\nredistributed to users bar, baz, and bletch.  thus, the simplest\npossible email list is \n\nmy-favorite-car:  member1, member2, member3, my-address\nmy-favorite-car-request: my-address\n\nthis has a couple of problems; the most noticeable one being that\nyou have to be superuser to edit the alias file.  however, you can\ndo the following, with the connivance of your sysadmin:\n\nmy-favorite-car: :include:/home/mydir/misc/autos/my-favorite-car-list\nmy-favorite-car-request: my-address\n\nWhere the file specified is a list of comma and newline separated\naddresses.  This file can be in the list admin's home directory,\nowned by the list admin.\n\nBounced Mail:\n\nthis still has a problem; bounced mail usually gets distributed to all the\nmembers of the list, which is generally considered somewhat irritating.\nTherefore, the way that the driving school mailing list is set up\nis instructive (Thanks to harpal chohan of the bmw list for this setup,\nby the way.  I'm not sure where he got it from.)\n\n\nschool-request:   welty\nschool-rebroadcast:  :include:/home/newwelty/misc/autos/school/list\nschool: \"|/usr/local/adm/bin/explscript school\"\nowner-school: school-request\nowner-school-out: school-request\n\n\nhere's what is going on here:\n\nthe owner- and -request addresses are intended as traps for bounced mail\ncoming from the network.  the -request address also serves as the point\nof contact for administrative duties.\n\nschool is what people send mail to; instead of pointing at addresses,\nit points at a shell script which rewrites headers before resending\nthe email.  school-broadcast (of which nobody except me knows the name;\nthe name has been changed here to protect my own sanity) points at the\nactual list members.\n\nthe shell script i use is as follows:\n\n-----------------\n#!/bin/sh\ncd /tmp\nsed -e '/^Reply-To:/d' -e '/^Sender:/d' -e '/^From /d' | \\\n        (echo Reply-To: ${1}@balltown.cma.com; \\\n         echo Errors-To: ${1}-request@balltown.cma.com; \\\n         echo Sender: ${1}-request@balltown.cma.com; \\\n         cat -) | \\\n        /usr/lib/sendmail -om -f ${1}-request@balltown.cma.com \\\n                -F \"The ${1} Mailing List\" ${1}-rebroadcast\nexit 0\n-------------------\n\nnote that this script does not know the name of the list; the name\nis passed in from outside, so that the script may be used for multiple\nlists (i run several out of this site.)\nthe script excises Reply-To:, Sender:, and From lines from the incoming\nmessage, substitutes for Sender: and Reply-To:, and adds Errors-to:\n99.9% of all email bounce messages end up being sent to the -request\nor owner- addresses if this header rewrite is done.\n\nFor digested lists, there is some digestification software around.\nHopefully I'll be able to provide more information in a future version\nof this posting.\n\nrichard welty (welty@balltown.cma.com)\n-- \nrichard welty        518-393-7228       welty@cabot.balltown.cma.com\n``Nothing good has ever been reported about the full rotation of\n  a race car about either its pitch or roll axis''  -- Carroll Smith\n</td><td>7</td><td>rec.autos</td></tr><tr><td>From: jimiii@nimbus.com (Jim Warford)\nSubject: Re: electronic odometers (was: Used BMW Question ..... ???)\nReply-To: jimiii@nimbus.com (Jim Warford)\nOrganization: Nimbus Technology, Santa Clara, CA USA\nLines: 32\n\nIn article <13269@news.duke.edu> klg@mookie.mc.duke.edu (Kim Greer) writes:\n>\n>  I was wondering if anyone can shed any light on just how it is that these\n>electronic odometers remember the total elapsed mileage?

I won the battle but \nlost the war.  The arbitrator found that the car was \ndefective, but decided to offer a repurchase well below \nmarket value :(.  At the time of the hearing, average \nretail on my truck in the NADA book was $21,025, but \nthe decision was for  $17,665.  I wrote a letter to the \nCouncil of Better Business Bureaus pointing out the \nfact that if you have an automobile that does not \ndepreciate rapidly, the manufacturer has no incentive \nto deal with you.  There is no way that the \nmanufacturer can loose because they can turn around and \nsell the vehicle at a profit if the consumer is awarded \na repurchase.  The attitude of Chevrolet's \nrepresentative at the hearing tends to support this \npoint of view;  he was totally unprepared and did not \nseem to take the proceeding very seriously.\n\nI decided to take the repurchase, even though I am \ngetting totally screwed on the price.  I will not have \nto deal with continuing repairs or selling a lemon \nmyself, and I have no case for a civil suit based on \nthe Idaho lemon law.  I am planning to send a letter to \nmy elected representatives telling them how utterly \nridiculous the Idaho lemon law is.  The law allows for \na \"use deduction\" equal to the IRS mileage allowance.  \nAs if Chevrolet were buying my gas and paying \nfor my insurance.\n\nSummary of the case:  In May 1992 I bought a new 3/4 ton\nHD Chevrolet pickup.  Between May 1992 and December 1992 \nthis vehicle required repair after repair.  Systems \nthat required attention included the transmission, \nheater fan, paint, suspension, and motor.  The main \nproblem was the five speed manual transmission.  They \ncould not install a non-defective transmission in at \nleast four attempts.\n\nSo, in summary, it is possible to get a repurchase, but \nyou are going to get screwed on the price, unless you \npaid too much in the first place, or if your car \nhappens to be a model that depreciates rapidly.\n\njackw@hpdmd48.boi.hp.com\n\n</td><td>7</td><td>rec.autos</td></tr><tr><td>Subject: Re: Ford SHO engine parts!\nFrom: david.bonds@cutting.hou.tx.us (David Bonds) \nReply-To: david.bonds@cutting.hou.tx.us (David Bonds) \nDistribution: world\nOrganization: The Cutting Edge - Houston, TX - 713-466-1525\nLines: 21\n\n\nW >>will NOT do work on internal engine components of the SHO engine.

The 60 is the `aspect ratio'; it indicates the height of the\n    sidewall of the tire relative to the overall width.  Our example tire\n    has a sidewall height of 0.60 * 195 ~= 117 mm.  The 14 is the wheel\n    diameter in inches; there are also some special tires called `TRX'\n    tires which have three digit metric wheel diameter designations, like\n    390, which is in millimeters.  The R means Radial, and the H is a speed\n    rating indicating the highest speed at which the tire, when properly\n    inflated and carrying an appropriate load, may safely operate.  Common\n    speed ratings are S (112MPH), T (118MPH), H (130MPH), and V (up to\n    150MPH.)\n\n    Recent changes to the method for specifying tire sizes move the speed\n    rating to a different part of the designation; you may therefore find\n    designations like 195/60R14 85H; the 85 indicates the per-tire load\n    associated with the speed rating -- exceeding this load in continuous\n    operation at the rated speed is dangerous practice.  What follows is\n    a table showing a number of `load indices' and corresponding maximum\n    per-tire loads:\n\n    Load Index       50   51   88   89   112   113   145   149   157\n    Max Load (Kg)   190  195  560  580  1120  1150  2900  3250  4125\n\n    Note that the usual mass vs. weight confusion occurs in this table.\n\n    In some cases, the letters P or LT may be found in front of a tire\n    size; the LT designation indicates Light Truck, and the P designation\n    indicates Passenger car.  If no letter is given, then the application\n    of the tire is Passenger car usage.  As far as I know, these letters\n    only appear in the US market.  The LT designation is prinicipally of\n    interest to owners of light trucks and other utility vehicles.  For\n    the owner of a passenger vehicle, there is no meaningful difference\n    between a tire with a P designation and one with no designation at\n    all.\n\n    If the aspect ratio is omitted, it is probably 80, but may be 78.\n\n    Tires with an MS (mud/snow) designation may have their speed rating\n    reduced by 20 km/h (about 12mph.)\n\n    There is an additional set of ratings on tires for temperature,\n    traction, and treadwear.  Temperature and Traction are graded\n    A, B, and C (with A the best and C the worst); treadwear is\n    a numeric rating.  These values are of limited value, as they\n    are assigned somewhat arbitrarily by tire manufacturers and are\n    thus not useful in comparing different brands of tires.\n\nQ:  My car has tires with a funny size designation:  185/65HR390; can i put\n    normal tires on the car?\n\nA:  Your tires are called TRX tires; they were devised by Michelin.\n    Because of a somewhat different bead design, they are incompatible\n    with normal tires; Michelin used a different diameter wheel for them\n    so that they could not be mounted on the wrong type wheel (and so that\n    more conventional tires could not be mounted on TRX type wheels.)\n    You will need to aquire different wheels to put a normal tire on your\n    car; it is barely possible to fit normal tires on TRX wheels, and horribly\n    dangerous to do so (the tires may simply peel off the rims in a corner,\n    or possibly blow out at high speed.)  TRX type tires are becoming hard\n    to find; in addition to Michelin, Avon makes suitable tires.  Goodyear\n    has apparently discontinued their line of TRX tires.\n\nQ:  Can I rotate radials from side to side, or rotate them only on one side\n    of my car?\n\nA:  Car and tire manufacturers have differing views on this subject; many\n    say that swapping radials between the left and right hand sides of a\n    car is now ok (this group includes Michelin and Goodyear); others\n    (for example, Pirelli and Nokia) will void warranties if such swapping\n    is done.  The best advice is to read your tire manual carefully before\n    rotating your tires, and stick to the manufacturer's recommendations.\n\nQ:  How many snow tires should I buy, and if I buy 2, which end of the\n    car should I put them on?\n\nA:  In short, 4, and both ends.  To explain, many drivers in areas that don't\n    get excessive snow or who don't drive agressively (or at all) in snow\n    conditions get away with only two snows on the drive wheels, but there\n    are circumstances where this can be dangerous practice.  With a rear\n    wheel drive car, you can choose between being able to start the car\n    going (a function of the rear axle) or stopping and turning the car\n    (a function of the front axle.)  In a front wheel drive car, you start,\n    stop, and turn with the front end.  The primary risk of putting the\n    snow tires on the front only is that if you have to put on the brakes\n    while going downhill, you run a serious risk of going downhill backwards.\n\nRadar Detectors and Speed Limits:\n\nQ:  Why aren't there any comments on Radar Detectors and Speed Limits\n    in this Q&A posting?\n\nA:  Because questions about detectors and speed limits crossposted between\n    misc.consumers and rec.autos.* always start long, tedious, and pointless\n    flame wars.  If you want to talk about either of these topics, please\n    subscribe to rec.autos or alt.flame and keep it there.\n\nSafety Equipment:\n\nQ:  Do airbags really work?\n\nA:  Preliminary statistics suggest the following:  Airbags work much\n    better than no belts; good 3 point belts alone work much better than\n    Airbags alone, and AirBags + 3 point belts work slightly better than\n    3 point belts alone.  The con to airbags is that some designs tend\n    to burn the driver's hands when venting the byproducts of the\n    explosion that occurs inside the bag, and that some designs (but\n    not all) may knock the driver's hands from the wheel, making retention\n    of control of the vehicle after the bag deflates more difficult.\n\nBrake Questions:\n\nQ:  Do I always need to get the rotors on my disk brakes turned?  Midas\n    always wants to do this.\n\nA:  No.  There are specific conditions that mandate turning or replacing\n    rotors; some shops try and make a little extra money by replacing rotors\n    more often than is strictly necessary.  if the rotors are not warped\n    warped, and only lightly grooved, then there is no need to replace or\n    to turn them.  Note also that some rotors (the rotors on many Hondas\n    are a good example) are so narrow to begin with that it is not practical\n    to turn them; they must be replaced when they become too thin, warped,\n    or badly grooved.\n\nQ:  They tell me I should downshift when braking to slow my car down.  Is\n    this really a good idea?\n\nA:  It used to be a very good idea, back in the days of mediocre, fade\n    prone drum brakes.  In modern disc brake equipped cars, use of\n    downshifting to slow the car is not really necessary, except in cases\n    of long, steep downhill runs.  Otherwise, modern disc brakes are more\n    than adequate to stop a passenger car in all circumstances, and they\n    are much cheaper to repair than clutch linings.\n\n    On the other hand, many standard driver's license tests in the USA\n    still specify that the driver being tested downshift under braking; I\n    suggest that before taking a US driver's test, you either 1) learn to\n    do this smoothly (which takes some time and practice) or 2) borrow a\n    car with an automatic to take the test.\n\nQ:  How often should I replace my brake fluid?\n\nA:  Probably more often than you do.  Traditional brake fluids tend to\n    absorb water; this water can corrode internal parts of the brake\n    system and also lower the boiling point of the fluid.  DOT-3 type\n    are older fluids; DOT-4 and DOT-5 are newer specifications.  The\n    principal differences are in wet and dry boiling points; the dry\n    boiling point is important in fresh brake fluid, but the wet boiling\n    point is important in older brake fluid.  DOT-3 fluids have the lowest\n    wet and dry boiling point _requirements_; DOT-4 fluids have better\n    boiling point requirements; and DOT-5 fluids have the best boiling\n    point requirements (but DOT-5 fluids are not clearly superior; see\n    the next Q&A for more details.)  While the requirements imply that\n    DOT-4 fluids are better than DOT-3 fluids, there may be specific\n    cases where a DOT-3 fluid is preferable, but these are mostly\n    competition applications.  Otherwise, DOT-4 type fluids offer _much_\n    improved brake pedal feel.  Replacement once a year is recommended for\n    DOT-4 fluids, although agressive drivers may profit by changing out\n    fluid more frequently, or at least bleeding a modest amount of fluid\n    out of the brake calipers fairly regularly.\n\nQ:  What about DOT-5 brake fluids?\n\nA:  This breaks down in to two parts.  The DOT-5 specification looks\n    excellent for performance, but the first DOT-5 fluids were Silicone\n    based.  Silicone fluids are a tricky proposition.  Unlike DOT-3 and\n    DOT-4 fluids, they do not absorb water at all.  While this may sound\n    like a feature, the problem is that any water present pools up in\n    such systems, interfering with braking performance and corroding any\n    metals at the spot where the pooling is occuring.  The water will tend\n    to migrate downwards in the braking system to the brake calipers, where\n    most of the corrosion occurs.\n\n    Because of this phenomenon, it is essential when converting to\n    Silicone to empty the entire brake system and flush it throughly\n    beforehand; some even recommend replacing all rubber parts in the\n    brake system when converting to Silicone fluids.\n\n    Two other issues that come up with silicone fluids:  1) they are\n    difficult to pour cleanly (that is, without air bubbles), which\n    interferes with getting a good brake pedal feel, and 2) while they\n    generally have much higher boiling points than DOT-4 fluids, they\n    do have high temperature failure modes which are indistinguishable\n    in effect from boiling DOT-4 fluids.  SIlicone fluids may make sense\n    in some street car applications, but they are certainly not\n    recommended for high performance driving applications, and the\n    economics are questionable for street use.\n\n    I have recently become aware of new fluids that meet the DOT-5 standard\n    that do not contain Silicones; these fluids appear to be reasonably\n    compatible with the older DOT-3 and DOT-4 fluids, but I have little\n    information at this time.\n\nQ:  ABS is available on some of the cars I'm looking at, but it costs\n    more.  Is it worth it?\n\nA:  This does not have a cut and dried answer; therefore, this answer will\n    be quite long in order to cover the pros and cons.  The short answer\n    is that ABS costs more, both initially, and to maintain, will generally\n    work better for the `average driver' (that is to say, a driver who does\n    not have extensive experience in high performance driving techniques),\n    and may require the `unlearning' of some obsolete braking techniques\n    like pump braking which should be unlearned in any case.\n\n    Now for the long answer.  ABS works by monitering the wheels of the\n    car, looking for signs of locked brakes.  It may or may not be able\n    be able to distinguish between the different wheels (there are several\n    systems on the market.)  It cannot detect impending lockup (which is\n    what you would really want in an ideal world), but only the existence\n    of lockup.  The sensors used vary; some of the less well designed\n    sensors are sensitive to tire size, and to brake pad material, and\n    may cease to function properly if the owner deviates from original\n    equipment or OE-equivalent components.\n\n    When the sensors detect lockup, the ABS system responds by unlocking\n    the brakes (either individually, or all at once, depending on the\n    system.)  If the driver keeps their foot firmly planted, the ABS\n    will end up cycling between the locked and unlocked states (if a\n    sensor existed that could detect _impending lockup_, then we could\n    sit right at that point, which is where maximum braking effect is\n    achieved.)  This pulsing can often be felt in the brake pedal, as\n    the system cycles.  The percentage of the time that the brakes are\n    truly engaged is called the `duty cycle'; typically in an ABS system\n    this is about 40%  On dry pavement, a trained driver can beat this\n    duty cycle quite reliably using a technique called threshold braking;\n    on wet pavement, braking is so chancy that ABS will outperform\n    threshold braking nearly every time.  Unfortunately, on mud and on\n    snow, often maximum braking effect can be acheived with the brakes\n    locked; only Audi, of the manufacturers producing ABS-equipped cars,\n    has seen fit to provide a disable switch for the ABS system for this\n    eventuality.\n\n    A particularly important feature of ABS is that it preserves\n    steering control.  This is the case simply because, if you are\n    braking near the limit and turn the wheel, the ABS will release\n    the brakes if it sees steering-triggered lockup, and back off\n    on the percentage of the time that the brakes are applied.\n    Braking distances will lengthen accordingly.\n\n    An important caution:  ABS cannot exceed the maximum theoretical\n    braking force in any given situation; if you start sliding on\n    glare ice, don't expect an ABS system to help you out very much.\n    The coefficient of friction is not changed by the presence of an\n    ABS system in your car.\n\n    As far as maintenence goes, in addition to the potential\n    restrictions I've listed above, you have to worry about the\n    following:  1) parts costs are much higher; the OE master cylinder\n    for my obscure european sedan lists for $185, but the OE master\n    cylinder for the ABS-equipped version of the same car lists for\n    over $1000.  Most manufacturers explicitly forbid use of DOT-5\n    (silicone) brake fluids in ABS-equipped vehicles.  Because of\n    the potential cost of replacement of corroded brake system\n    components, regular (I suggest annual) replacement of brake fluid\n    becomes very important.\n\nQ:  What about this threshold braking business?\n\nA:  [normally, I'd not put this in the consumers Q&A, but recent\n    publicity about a number of accidents involving police drivers\n    in ABS-equipped Chevy Caprices suggests that this section is\n    needed here -- rpw]\n\n    Threshold braking is a technique practiced by all serious high\n    performance drivers; if made a habit, it replaces the `stab\n    the pedal and lock 'em up' panic habit entirely, and is much\n    to be prefered.  Basically, the premise is that tires generate\n    maximum braking force when they have just started to slide, but\n    just before the wheels lock up entirely.  Drivers who threshold\n    brake learn to feel what this `threshold' feels like, and learn\n    to search for it and hit it on the application of the brake\n    pedal.  In many cars, you can feel that you are near the\n    threshold when the pedal starts to firm up as you depress it.\n    In any case, if you can't hear the tires whine just a bit, you're\n    not very near the threshold.\n\n    In a car with ABS, often there is a twinge in the pedal just\n    before the system starts cycling; if the driver backs off on\n    the pedal just a tad when the twinge is felt, then they are very\n    close to the threshold and they'll probably achieve better\n    stopping distances than if they just punched it and let the ABS\n    take over.\n\n    Recently, there has been a rash of publicity over a number of\n    accidents, and one death, involving police cars equipped with\n    ABS systems.  The police departments in question quickly blamed\n    the new ABS systems, but according to Autoweek magazine, it now\n    seems clear that the problem was a lack of training; none of the\n    involved officers had any recent performance driving training.\n    There is reason to believe that the drivers reacted to the pulsing\n    brake pedal by `pump braking', an old and discredited technique\n    of stabbing and releasing the brake pedal, the goal being to\n    try and get brakes back with a failing hydraulic system.  If you\n    think about it for a minute, you'll realize that pump braking must\n    cut the effective operation of a working brake system by at least\n    1/2, so if you cut the 40% duty cycle of an ABS system by that\n    much, you are giving up most of your brakes for the wrong reason.\n    Threshold braking has the advantage in that it is an effective\n    and useful technique regardless of whether your car has ABS; if\n    you do fear a failed hydraulic system, then one or two stabs at\n    the pedal will be sufficient.    \n\nGas Questions:\n\nQ:  Does High Octane gasoline help?\n\nA:  Maybe, maybe not.  Some cars have knock sensors, and can adjust the\n    engine timing or turbocharger boost to suit the gasoline being used.\n    On most cars, however, you should use the cheapest gas that makes your\n    car run well.  Check your owner's manual for details on what your car\n    needs.\n\nQ:  My car was made for leaded gasoline.  Will unleaded gas hurt it?\n\nA:  It is possible that unleaded gas may *slightly* increase valve wear,\n    although the Amoco Oil company argues otherwise.  The actual increase\n    in valve wear will be almost unnoticeable, however, as modern leaded\n    gasolines actually contain very little lead.  You should, however,\n    check your owner's manual; many cars from the early 1970s do not\n    actually require leaded gasoline.\n\nQ:  Do fuel treatments help?  What kind should I use?\n\nA:  Some do and some don't.  During the winter, it is a good idea to use\n    dry gas; however, some may be harmful to fuel injection systems.\n    Never use an additive containing Methanol (sometimes called Methyl\n    Alcohol); such additives may damage fuel systems in cars with carbs\n    and almost certainly will damage cars with fuel injection.\n\n    Manufacturer's opinions vary on additives containing Ethanol (sometimes\n    called Ethyl Alcohol); if your car has fuel injection, check the owner's\n    manual on your car before  using these.  Most manufacturers consider\n    10% Ethanol acceptable in gasoline.  Additives with Isopropyl Alcohol\n    (Isopropanol), and Petroleum  Distillates are fine in fuel injected\n    cars.\n\n    An occasional bottle of fuel injector cleaner is helpful in cars with\n    fuel injectors, although many premium gasolines contain detergents that\n    do the same job.  Some off brands of fuel injector cleaners contain\n    Ethanol or Methanol; always check the ingredients before putting anything\n    in your gas tank.\n\n    There are a small number of particularly good additives; these are\n    noticeably more expensive that the run-of-the-mill ones, but work\n    much, much better.  Among these are Chevron Techron, Redline SL-1,\n    Wurth `Lubrimoly Ventil Sauber', and BG 44K.  A bottle of one of these,\n    once every six months, is highly recommended.\n\nQ:  What about detergent gasolines?\n\nA:  The quality of detergent packages in gasolines varies somewhat; BMW\n    has instituted a testing program, and gasoline brands which pass this\n    test may advertise that fact.  Stickers indicating passage of the test\n    are now beginning to appear on fuel pumps at gas stations.  If such\n    gasolines are used, then fuel injector cleaners are probably optional.\n    Beforewarned that while use of BMW approved gasolines will keep a clean\n    engine clean, they may not clean a motor with bad valve deposits.\n\nLubrication Questions:\n\nQ:  What do the numbers and letters in a motor oil designation mean?\n\nA:  There are several different items encoded.  There is a two-letter\n    code indicating the type of detergent package that the manufacturer\t\n    uses in the oil; this looks like SE,SF,CD or such.  The S codes are\n    for gasoline engine applications; the C codes are for diesel engine\n    applications.  The second letter is assigned in sequence as new levels\n    of protection are developed; thus SF is considered better than SE,\n    SE is considered better than SD, and so forth.\n\n    The more noticeable designation is the oil weight.  This is either\n    a single number (e.g., 30 weight) or a pair of numbers separated by\n    the letter W (e.g., 10W30.)  The latter type is much more commonly\n    used these days, and are the only type that most automobile\n    manufacturers specify in operators manuals.  The first number in the\n    designation (10W) is the apparent viscosity of the oil when it is cold;\n    the W stands for `winter'.  The second number (30) is the viscosity\n    of the oil when hot.  There is a trick here; the oil doesn't actually\n    get thicker (turn from 10 weight to 30 weight) as it gets hotter.  What\n    is actually happening is that when the oil is cold, it has the viscosity\n    of a cold 10 weight oil.  as it gets hotter, it doesn't get thin as fast\n    as a 10W oil would; by the time it is up to temperature, it has the\n    viscosity of a hot 30 weight oil.\n\n    Note that these numbers actually specify ranges of viscosities; not\n    all 10W oils have exactly the same viscosity when cold, and not all\n    30 weight oils have the same viscosity when hot.  Note also that the\n    novel behaviour of multi-grade oils is caused by additives, and it has\n    been reported that with the sole exception of Castrol GTX, 10W40 oils\n    do not retain their multi-grade characteristics well over time.  10W30,\n    15W40, and 20W50 oils work very well, though.\n\nQ:  Are `quick lube' places any good?\n\nA:  Some do adequate work, but there are quite a few incompetent ones out\n    there.  Let the buyer beware, watch them while they work, make sure\n    that they don't overtorque the oil drain plug, and keep your hand on\n    your wallet at all times.\n\nQ:  Are oil additives like Slick-50 or Tufoil any good?\n\nA:  Slick-50 and Tufoil are PTFE-based additives.  Many of these have\n    come onto the market recently; they are different from the moly-based\n    additives that have been around since the early 50's.  PTFE is the\n    chemical name for Teflon(TM), a trademark owned by DuPont. In general,\n    auto manufacturers do not recommend use of these products.  Most USENET\n    responses to questions on these additives are favorable (slight\n    increase of MPG after application, smoother revving) but long term\n    results (whether PTFE additives are effective after 5K miles) are\n    debatable.  Some manufacturers (such as Saab) claim that either the\n    product or the engine flush that preceeds application causes\n    deterioration of the oil seals and eventual leakage.  Some BMW owners\n    have reported death of valve seals shortly after the addition of\n    Slick 50 to their cars.  This writer has been cautioned by a Slick-50\n    Dealer (!) that Slick-50 should _not_ be used in Japanese motors, as\n    it may clog the oil return passages in the engine.  Otherwise, there are\n    no known reports of damage caused by PTFE additives.\n\n    On the other hand, there are satified Slick 50 customers in the world.\n\nQ:  Do synthetic oils really work?\n\nA:  Yes, but.  More specifically, most auto manufactuers accept synthetics,\n    but disagree with the extremely long oil change intervals claimed by\n    oil manufacturers.  Auto manufacturers recommend that you continue to\n    change oil at the intervals recommended in the owners manual for your\n    car.  Even if you decide to try the longer intervals, at least change\n    the oil filter at regular intervals, as synthetics get just as dirty\n    as conventional oils.\n\n    Synthetic gear lubricants for manual transmissions are another matter\n    entirely; Amsoil, Redline, and AGIP are very highly regarded and very\n    effective.  Mobil 1 synthetic gear lube gets mixed reviews, however.\n\nQ:  Manufacturers are specifying longer and longer oil change intervals.\n    How often should I change my oil?\n\nA:  It depends on how you drive.  If your car always (or nearly always)\n    gets warmed up, and you don't drive it very hard and keep the revs\n    down, the manufacturer's recommendation is probably fine.  If, however,\n    you drive it hard, drive it at high revs, or alternatively, if you\n    only drive it to and from the supermarket so that it doesn't get up\n    to temperature, then you may wish to change oil much more often,\n    perhaps at 3000 mile intervals (given that most manufacturers are\n    now specifying 7500 mile intervals.)  If you don't drive your car\n    much at all (say 7500 miles a year), then you probably want to change\n    oil every six months anyway.  If you are storing a car during the winter,\n    then change oil before storing it and change oil when you bring it out\n    of storage.\n\nMisc. Questions:\n\nQ:  My car has a timing belt.  I hear that bad things happen when they\n    break.  What's the story?\n\nA:  It depends on the internal design of the motor.  Early Ford Escorts,\n    for example, will suffer severe valve damage if the belt breaks, but\n    the newer cars will just require a tow and installation of a new belt.\n    Some Honda motors will not be damaged, but others will be.\n\n    If no replacement interval is specified for your car, then change the\n    belt at least every 60,000 miles; some cars may require more frequent\n    replacement.  Ask your dealer or independent mechanic.  Also, ask if\n    there are any related repairs that should take place at the same time\n    (for example, the same Ford Escorts that suffer valve damage also have\n    a timing belt driven water pump, which has been known to seize,\n    destroying the timing belt, and which then causes major valve damage\n    as a side effect.  Replacing the timing belt while ignoring the water\n    pump can be a costly mistake.)\n\nQ:  Why would anyone be stupid enough to design a motor so that it\n    self destructs when the timing belt breaks?\n\nA:  For performance reasons.  Compromising piston design so that the\n    valves and pistons will not collide requires that the compression\n    ratio of the engine be reduced significantly; this is why you are\n    more likely to avoid valve damage in economy cars than in performance\n    oriented vehicles.\n\nQ:  What causes Unintended Acceleration?\n\nA:  The final report of the National Highway, Transportation, and Safety\n    Administration concluded that unintended acceleration could not be\n    caused by any mechanical failure of the vehicle in question and at the\n    same time be consistent with the physical evidence.  The NHTSA report\n    goes on to conclude that `pedal misapplication' by the vehicle operator\n    is probably the cause.\n-- \nrichard welty        518-393-7228       welty@cabot.balltown.cma.com\n``Nothing good has ever been reported about the full rotation of\n  a race car about either its pitch or roll axis''  -- Carroll Smith\n</td><td>7</td><td>rec.autos</td></tr><tr><td>From: pp29616@dcl-nextsc.cso.uiuc.edu (Paul Park)\nSubject: Re: Integra GSR (really about other cars)\nArticle-I.D.: news.C51Fs3.37C\nOrganization: University of Illinois at Urbana\nLines: 21\n\nIn article <1993Apr5.212645.15988@nntpd.lkg.dec.com>  \nkenyon@xqzmoi.enet.dec.com (Doug Kenyon (Stardog Champion)) writes:\n> \n> It's great that all these other cars can out-handle, out-corner, and  \nout-\n> accelerate an Integra.\n> \n> But, you've got to ask yourself one question: do all these other cars  \nhave\n> a moonroof with a sliding sunshade?

Drivers are much better disciplined in Europe than they are here.\n\nOh yeah, that would be paradise... in fact, you can forget it. From all I've\nheard from my U.S. relatives, drivers esp. here in Germany are much more agg-\nressive, but not disciplined. One of my relatives, a L.A. resident, hired a car\nat the Nuernberg airport and went about 18 miles to our home. He said then that\nhe grew about 1 year older during this ride and swore he'd never drive a car in\nGermany again (this was in 1982 and he kept his promise - the situation now is\neven worse as effect of the increased volume of traffic).\nWhat you mean by `better disciplined' should perhaps be considered `cautious due\nto fear': \nWhen driving around here, you always *have* to take into consideration that the\nmajority of the other drivers absolutely relies on you: They expect that nobody\nfails or sleeps; many of them exploit this by driving as fast as their car can\ngo (of course only where that is allowed, you might think - dream on :).\nSo any mistake you make is a very high risk to your health - and if you're ex-\nposed to such a situation from your very first day as a driver, you learn to\nhandle it - or you lose... \nThat's the way I and most people I know experience our traffic situation - \nwhether you think this is pleasant or efficient is up to you; I think we handle\na very high volume of traffic and that at high speeds with modest (compared to\nthe volume) and decreasing rates of lethal accidents - OTOH, more and more\npeople (esp. women) dislike driving (because they feel overtaxed and threatened)\nand each accident is one accident too much.\n\n>2. The roads comprising the Autobahn are much better designed than\n>   they are here, and usually include animal fences.  This makes them\n>   far more predictable than most US highways.\n\nBetter designed and maintained, may be - but animal fences are very rare. Auto-\nbahnen and many other streets have guard-rails (I hope that's the right word - \na plank made from thick steel sheet fixed on uprights; it's about 2 feet high);\nthose guard-rails are designed for keeping vehicles on the road.

When that light goes on, I just\ntake it to the delaer tell them \"It's that time\" and they work on it for 4 hou\nand you pay $5 for parts and $100 for labor. (Ahh...what they get for labor)\nI currently have about 95K on my Sprint and of all the times I took it in for\nservice, I never say on the payment sheet anything about the replacement of the\nOxygen sensor.  What the heck is an Oxygen sensor?  As far an I know of, I have\nnever had that thing replaced in my car and the car is purring like a kitten.\nNow, I don't have a/c (Mother Nature does that for me :-) ) and that might have\nsomething to do with it, but I still never heard of an Oxygen sensor.  The only\nMAJOR service job I have had on my car (besides getting the tires replaced\nif you want to call that a service job) was getting the Rotor, Distributor and\nGasket replaced.  And that was all done within the past 2 months.  \n\nWhat I do at 30K is have a good tune-up, let them replace what ever they need\nto, pay the bill (about $125) and go home and don't worry about the car for\nanother 30K.  Oh, I just remembered something.  If that little sensor light\nbothers you, in the fuse box right below the turn-signal lever up against\nthe dash, there is a swith on the right side.  Flip that switch and the light\nwill go off.  I do that so that little light won't annoy me.  If you can't\nfind it, look it up in the car manuel.  I hope that I have helped a little\nand good luck with the _Oxygen sensor_?\n\n\t\t\t\t- Thomas -\n\n******************************************************************************\n*  E-Mail Address: \t\t  *  \"Give me an an army of West Point,      *\n*\tTJZ6624@ZEUS.TAMU.EDU\t  *   graduates and I'll win a battle...     *\n*\t\t\t\t  *   Give me a handful of Texas Aggies,     *\n*  \"Creator of MOT POWER!\"\t  *   and I'll win a war.\"                   *\n*\t\t\t\t  *\t  - Gen.

There are actually many courteous drivers \non the road who do not intentionally impede others.  \n\nIf someone in front of me seems to be oblivious to the fact that they \nare blocking traffic I use my blinker or flash my lights, or, if all \nelse fails, will briefly speed up /slow down so they MIGHT get the \nmessage that I am a faster vehicle trying to pass.  I feel it is never \nsafe to ride anyone's bumper.  IF someone is intentionally blocking \ntraffic, because they feel that it is civil duty or philosophic duty \nor for some unfathomable reason, I feel they deserve, at the very least,\nderision.

There are two very long entry ramps which all the hurry-up\nyahoos dive into cause they want to get ahead. When we get to the point\nwhere these ramps merge, all hell breaks lose. The result is that traffic\nwhich was moving at 55 on the VA side of the bridge, stalls on t'other\nside. If these dingbats had stayed in lane, allowed the folks coming up\nthe two ramps to merge, we would still be doing 55. Instead we do start-\nstop for 4 miles.

Needless to say, they were not pleased by  \nthe turn of events.\n\nEarly the next morning I got a call from the general sales manager wanting  \nto know what happened. I related the story and he apologised profusely and  \nasked if there was anything they could do to change my mind. I told him  \nthat if they gave me the truck for free I probably still wouldn't take it,  \nthat there were other dealers in town, I was a repeat customer of theirs  \nand that they should learn how to treat customers,etc,etc...I was still  \npretty steamed about the whole affair. He gave me the line about hating to  \nlose a customer and they would try to find a solution, etc, etc. I told  \nhim not to bother, thanks, I'd go somewhere else.\n\nA couple hours later, the owner of the dealership called me, all  \napologetic, etc, etc, etc, and said that they would cover the $150 plus  \nknock another $400 off the price of the truck. I told him I'd think about  \nit and he gave me his private, direct phone number, his secretary's name,  \nand assured me that they valued me as a customer, etc etc etc....\n\nI thought about it for a few hours and discussed it with my wife and we  \ndecided, what the hell...that was a pretty decent deal, so I called him  \nback and accepted his offer. When I went back the next day to pick up the  \ntruck, I received the royal treatment. Everyone seemed to know about the  \nincident, even the lot boy. Everything went smoothly and I was out of  \nthere in my new truck in about 30 mins.\n\nSo, I guess I'm a reasonably satisfied customer. However, it should not  \nhave happened in the first place. I was a bit shocked to have a sales  \nperson talk to me like that. I don't expect them to bow and grovel, but I  \nsure don't expect to be given a hard time either, esp. when it's their  \nmistake.\n\nAnyway, I'm happy with the truck and it turned out to be a couple hundred  \ndollars under invoice and they paid most of the first year's license fee.  \nI'm not sure whether I'll go back to that dealer, tho.\n\nMark\n</td><td>7</td><td>rec.autos</td></tr><tr><td>From: markm@latium.

The older cars are \nappreciating... slowly.

The solid axle is theoretically stronger and\nmore reliable than the newer model, but only experience will tell. The\nindependant front suspension is, no doubt, a compromise made to satisfy\nthe typical user, who will never need a real utility vehicle. The second\ndifference is the type of transfer case used on the newer models. I'm\nnot sure, but I think Tioyota went to a full-time 4WD or all-wheel drive\nsystem. The older Landcruisers have a \"lock-up\" type. Both have their\nadvantages and disadvantages.\n\n\tPaul Hovnanian\thovnania@atc.boeing.com\n\t[Std disclaimers apply]\n</td><td>7</td><td>rec.autos</td></tr><tr><td>From: barryf@hpfcso.FC.HP.COM (Barry Fowler)\nSubject: Re: Impala SS going into production!\nOrganization: HP Colorado Computer Mfg.

When a friend of mine went shopping for a small\nsedan a few years ago, she brought me along as a token male so\nthe salespeople wouldn't give her the \"bimbo\" treatment.\nHer first choice was a Mazda 323, and second choice was a Nissan\nSentra.  We went to a Mazda dealership and described what \"we\"\nwanted.  We started negotiating on the price, and the salesdroid\nkept playing the \"let me run this price by the sales manager\".  After\nplaying the \"good salesman, bad salesman\" game, we finally told him\nthat if he didn't have the authority to negotiate a price, perhaps\nwe should be speaking directly to someone who did.  He brought in\nthe sales manager who proceeded to dick us around with every trick\nin the book.  (Read Remar Sutton's \"Don't Get Taken Every Time\" for a\nlist.)  Finally, after playing a few more rounds of \"you'll have to\nwork with us on this price\", also known as \"each time you come up a\nthousand dollars we'll come down ten\", the salesmanager gave a signal to\nhis two sales cronies, stood up, and said \"well, we can't come down any\nmore so I guess we can't help you\" and they trouped out of the room,\nleaving us sitting in the salesman's office all by ourselves.  Hmm.\nI'd read that sleazy salesmen sometimes bug their own offices so they\ncan leave and listen in on couples discussing the sales offer, and\nI mentioned this aloud to my friend while we were sitting there wondering\nwhy they would leave us in the office instead of showing us to the\ndoor.  For lack of anything better to do, I picked up the phone on\nthe desk and called another Mazda dealership, asked for a salesman,\nand began discussing what kind of price they would consider.  A few\nsentences into the conversation, Mr. Salesmanager broke into the line\n(!) and began telling me how rude he thought it was that I would call\nanother dealership from \"his\" phone!  I said that since he'd announced\nthat our business was over, he shouldn't care, and every time I tried\nto talk to the other sales guy the sales manager would drown out our\nvoices with his own.  (How did he know that I was using the phone,\nanyway?)  Finally, I hung up and we headed out of the showroom.\nSales manager and cronies come out of a little unmarked room and he\nbegins to berate us again.  We say that we won't bother him anymore,\nwe're going next door to the Nissan dealership.\n\nThen comes the part I wish I could have videotaped.  As we go out\nthe front door, the sales manager SHOUTS across the entire showroom,\ncustomers and all, \"Go ahead!  You DESERVE to buy a Nissan!\"\nSo my friend bought a Sentra.\n\nJust so the guilty won't go unpunished, I'll mention that the\nsales manager's name was Gary Tusone.  From his manner, his\nrefusal to come down to a reasonable price, and his anger at the\nend, my guess is that he had bet our original salesman (who was\na young novice) that he'd be able to get at least X dollars out of\nus, and he was steamed that we wouldn't fall for his slimy tricks.\n</td><td>7</td><td>rec.autos</td></tr><tr><td>From: ak296@yfn.ysu.edu (John R.

A family sedan designed to be\noperable at 85mph doesn't suddenly become operable at 130mph because\nyou added some plastic aero effects, slightly wider tires, and a much\nlarger engine.  That's what the SHO is -- a slightly modified family\nsedan with a powerful engine.  They didn't even bother improving the\n*brakes.*\n\nThe Mustang is essentially the same deal as the SHO -- a big power\nplant stuck in a mid-size sedan, with almost no other modifications.\nI have real-life experience with the Mustang -- it handles like a\nbrick (except when you're invoking oversteer, of course, something I\npersonally avoid doing on the highway) and stopping power is\ninadequate even from 80mph.  Lots of accelleration -- but the rest of\nthe car is not up to par.\n\nI picked the Porsche example because they are designed with speed in\nmind.  It didn't have to be the 911 -- it could have been the much\ncheaper 944 or one of several Mercedes or Audi models.  All of these\ncars are fairly expensive -- but so are the parts that make them\ndrivable at high speed.  This should be elementary.\n\nThere are a few things to keep in mind about Europe, since you brought\nit up.  My Autobahn knowledge is admittedly second-hand, but I believe\nthe following to be true:\n\n1. Drivers are much better disciplined in Europe than they are here.\n2. The roads comprising the Autobahn are much better designed than\n   they are here, and usually include animal fences.  This makes them\n   far more predictable than most US highways.\n3. Not all of Europe is the Autobahn.  Most places in Europe have\n   speed limits that aren't out-of-line with what we used to have in\n   the US -- if my friends weren't lying to me they're typically not\n   much higher than 120km/h.\n\nI strongly suspect you won't find a lot of Rabbit owners doing 120mph\n(nearly 200km/h) on the Autobahn, but I could be wrong.

Fuel injector \ncleaning is done properly with a can of injector cleaner solvent which is\nhooked up to the fuel system under high pressure. The car is actually run on\nthe solvent during the cleaning process. The equipment to properly do this is\npricey, and generally not something the average home mechanic has.

There has been a \ndiscussion of these products on here from time to time, and Chevron Techron\n(not Pro-Gard with Techron) is generally regarded as the best.

You will see the floppy disk and\n    hard drive mounted in a plastic tower. Follow the usual anti-static\n    precautions and of course make sure the machine is OFF when you do\n    this. Unplug the wall and monitor power supply cords from the back\n\tof the mac.\n \n3)  Remove the power supply by pulling the plastic interlocking tab on the\n    tower forward and simultaneously pulling the power supply straight up.\n    The tab is a piece of plastic from the left posterior aspect of the\n    tower which extends downward to hook on to the power supply. You may\n    also feel a horseshoe shaped piece at the right portion of the power\n    supply. Leave that alone. The plastic tab from the tower is all you\n    need release.\n \n4)  Look at the rear of the tower assembly. You will see the flat ribbon\n    SCSI connector to the hard drive, a power cable and a flat ribbon cable\n    leading to the floppy drive. Disconnect all these from the motherboard.\n    The hard drive power cable connector has a tab which must be squeezed\n    to release it.\n                                            \n5)  Unplug the drive activity LED from its clear plastic mount\n\n6)  Look down the posterior, cylindrical section of the plastic tower. A\n    phillips head screw is at the base. Remove it, taking care not to drop\n    it into the case. A bit of gummy glue on your screwdriver is helpful\n    here.\n\n7)  Remove the tower assembly by pulling medially the plastic tab on the\n    right side of the tower. This tab prevents the tower from sliding\n\tposteriorly. Slide the entire tower assembly 1 cm posteriorly then\n\tlift the tower assembly straight up and out of the case.\n\n8)  Congratulations, you have now gained access to your machine's SIMM\n    slots.\n\n9)  The six big slots are for VRAM. One usually must install all six to\n    gain useful video modes. All SIMMS (RAM or VRAM)  installed with their\n\tchips facing the front of the motherboard.\n\t\n    The four smaller sockets in front are for RAM SIMMS. Install SIMMS in\n\tsets of four into these sockets. Be sure you seat the SIMMS squarely\n\tand firmly into a fully upright position.\n\t\n10) Reinstall the tower assembly by first placing the right wall of the\n    tower against the right wall of the case with the tower assembly about\n\t1 cm posterior of its intended position. Lower the tower assembly into\n\tplace while maintaining contact with the right wall of the case.\n    Once fully down, slide the tower assembly anteriorly until it clicks\n    into place.\n\t\n11) Reconnect the motherboard ends of the cables. DONT'T FORGET THE FLOPPY\n    DRIVE CABLE.\n\n12) Replace the phillips head screw\n\n13) Drop the power supply straight down into place until it clicks in.\n\n14) Plug the hard drive activity light back into its clear plastic mount\n\nGuy Kuo <guykuo@u.washington.edu>\n\n</td><td>4</td><td>comp.sys.mac.hardware</td></tr><tr><td>From: kssimon@silver.ucs.indiana.edu (kenneth steven simon)\nSubject: Re: HELP: Need modem info for Duo 210\nSummary: very hard to get a modem \nNntp-Posting-Host: silver.ucs.indiana.edu\nOrganization: Indiana University\nLines: 34\n\n  jdsiegel@garnet.berkeley.edu (Joel Siegel) writes:\n\n  jmilhoan@magnus.acs.ohio-state.edu (JT) writes:\n\n  >Hi... what alternatives to the Express modem do Duo owners have (if\n  >they want to go at least 9600 baud)?\n\n  >Every place in town says they are back ordered, and part of the reason\n  >I want a laptop mac is so I can use it as a remote terminal from\n  >wherever I am, but I really would hate to have to wait 2 months to get\n  >a modem in or have to settle with 2400 baud.\n\nIf Apple didn't put out such a good product -- I'd gladly take my\nbusiness to -- to -- the 8-bit Ataris.

The problem occurs when\nthe processor bus errors trying to access the SCSI chip when the next byte\nhasn't been clocked yet.

Some boxes have internal terminators; some can be switched out and\nothers are socketted.  These count.  If the box with internal terminations\ncannot be put on the end to terminate the cabling, they have to be\ndisabled, ie, switched out or pulled out of their sockets.

According to the latest MacLeak, the \ndrive has a 14.5 ms access time, 1.9 MB/s sustained throughput (these figures\nare from memory so they could be slightly off, but they give you an idea of\nperformance nonetheless). The drive was originally released for the PC\nand just recently was released for the Mac world (don't ask me what the \ndifferences are) and through they are currently in limited supply, according\nto a Syquest rep. they are in the process of ramping up for mass production.\nI have already seen them advertised by a number of manufacturers in MacLeak\nincluding PLI, MassMicro, ClubMac, and MacWarehouse's PowerUser.

The relevant parts are:\n\n  922-0358  blank bezel faceplate\n  922-0850  CD-ROM carrier [i.e., generic 5.25\" device mounting bracket]\n\nNote Apple's unfortunate choice of name for the slide-in bracket to\nmount a 5.25\" device.  The service techs I talked to said, \"Oh sure,\nwe stock those.\"  Of course they were thinking of the CD caddies to\nhold a CD disk when you stick it in the drive.\n\nAs far as I can tell, Apple does not sell a bezel faceplate already\ncut out for a standard 5.25\" device.  (Why not?  They advertise\nthese machines as being able to accept any standard device in the\n5.25\" bay, why not provide the faceplate?)   They do sell a cutout for\ntheir CD-ROM drive (of course), but that's of no use.\n\nI'm going to hack up the extra bezel I ordered to make a cutout for my\ntape drive, which is a standard 5.25\" device.\n\nGood luck with your SyQuest.\n\n\t-Fred\n\n\n</td><td>4</td><td>comp.sys.mac.hardware</td></tr><tr><td>From: jaker@csugrad.cs.vt.edu (Jacob Rose)\nSubject: Re: Position of 'b' on Erg.

The accelerator costs about $1400 whereas\nthe upgrade costs $2131 (just quoted from my dealer).  However the Q700\nupgrade gives you very fast built in video that supports monitors up to 21\"\nwith 8 bit depth and up to 16\" at 24 bit depth (with additional VRAM).  It\nalso has a SCSI port capable of a much faster throughput than the CI, which\nmakes a big difference if you have a fast hard drive.\n\n  If the improved video and SCSI features are important to you, you're\nbetter off getting the Q700 upgrade, otherwise save some money and get an\naccelerator.\n\nPaul\n</td><td>4</td><td>comp.sys.mac.hardware</td></tr><tr><td>From: jartsu@hut.fi (Jartsu)\nSubject: Good display card for 14\" multisync?\nNntp-Posting-Host: lk-hp-20.hut.fi\nReply-To: jartsu@vipunen.hut.fi\nOrganization: Helsinki University of Technology, Finland\nLines: 20\n\n\nHi there!\n\nI wonder if anyone knows and can recommend me a good NuBus display\ncard for driving a 14\" multisync (NEC 3D)?\nThe NEC 3D can do horizontal refresh from 15.5 kHz to 38 kHz and\nvertical from 50 Hz to 90 Hz and can do max 1024x768 interlaced,\nthough I am looking for something more like 800x600 or 832x624\nnoninterlaced.\nIt would be very nice to find a card which can be programmed quite\nfreely within these limits and is capable to display at least\n8bits/pixel, preferably more.\n\nIs there anything on the market that comes even close?\n\n\nThanks\n\n--\nJartsu\n</td><td>4</td><td>comp.sys.mac.hardware</td></tr><tr><td>From: blast@nntp.crl.com (Tim Keanini)\nSubject: Mac SCSI spec?\nLines: 20\nNNTP-Posting-Host: crl.com\n\nI have a MacIIFX and I know that it is wired about its SCSI chain.\n\nI just bought a drive and I need to find out a few hardcore SCSI question:\n\nDoes the IIFX SCSI chain want to see active or passive termination?\n\nDoes the IIFX SCSI spec want me to enable the initiation of the SDTR message?\n\nWHat does the IIFX SCSI spec want as far as parity checking?\n\nThese are some very good questions for the FAQ.       \nIf someone does not have time to answer these questions but does know \nwhere I can look them up please let me know and I will repost the answers\nfor everyone to see.\n\nthanks,\n\nTim Keanini        <timk@broder.com>  or  <blast@crl.com>\nSound Engineer         Broderbund Software\n\n</td><td>4</td><td>comp.sys.mac.hardware</td></tr><tr><td>From: d88-jwa@hemul.nada.kth.se (Jon Wätte)\nSubject: Re: Interesting ADB behaviour on C650\nNntp-Posting-Host: hemul.nada.kth.se\nOrganization: Royal Institute of Technology, Stockholm, Sweden\nLines: 23\n\nIn <1993Apr16.091202.15500@waikato.ac.nz> ldo@waikato.ac.nz (Lawrence D'Oliveiro, Waikato University) writes:\n\n>I have heard of no such warnings from anybody at Apple.

The Duos require a kind of dynamic RAM called\nselfrefreshing, which can recharge itself while the system sleeps.  But\nTechnology Works said some vendors have sold Duo cards with\nnonselfrefreshing DRAM, which can cause the system to lose data or fail to\nwake from sleep.\n\n     Most leading memory manufacturers include the letter V in the part\nnumber stamped on their self-refreshing chips; nonself-refreshing chips\ninstead have an L, according to TechWorks.  The chip label, however, may\nnot tell the whole story.  Newer Technology of Wichita, Kan., said it uses\nnonself-refreshing chips but adds its own circuitry to keep them refreshed\nwhile the Duo sleeps.\n\n     > Speed.  Some RAM-card vendors have put 80-nanosecond DRAM on Duo\ncards rather than the 70-nanosecond type the 230 requires, Technology\nWorks said.  However, some chips labeled as 80- or 85-nanosecond are\ncertified by the manufacturer to run at a higher speed.\n\n     Kingston Technology Corp. of Fountain Valley, Calif., said it offers\nDuo RAM cards with 80-nanosecond chips, but only for the Duo 210, which is\ncompatible with the slower chips.\n\n     > Space.  Technology Works charged and Apple officials confirmed that\nsome third-party cards are too large to fit properly, forcing the corner\nof the Duo keyboard up and preventing the system from starting up normally\nwhen in a Duo Dock.\n\n     Lifetime Memory Products Inc. of Huntington Beach, Calif., said it\noriginally shipped cards with this problem but has since offered all\ncustomers free upgrades to cards that fit.\n\n</td><td>4</td><td>comp.sys.mac.hardware</td></tr><tr><td>From: chyang@leghorn.engin.umich.edu (Chung Hsiung Yang)\nSubject: Re: CD300 & 300i\nOrganization: University of Michigan Engineering, Ann Arbor\nLines: 28\nDistribution: world\nNNTP-Posting-Host: leghorn.engin.umich.edu\nOriginator: chyang@leghorn.engin.umich.edu\n\n\nIn article <bauer-060493101758@134.60.68.23>, bauer@informatik.uni-ulm.de (Christian Bauer) writes:\n> In article <Afi9sHS00VohMrYlEe@andrew.cmu.edu>, \"Donpaul C.

I owned a 1985 Toyota Celica\nGT.  I decided to buy myself a gift - a more exotic car.  Front runners\nincluded the Toyota Supra Turbo and the Porsche 924 (1987 model years).\nI narrowed it down to those two.  I liked the simplicity and handling\n(and snob appeal, too) of driving a Porsche.  The Supra Turbo was less\nmoney and had more features and performance - almost a personal luxury\ncar.  It had better acceleration and a higher top speed than the 924.\nI was almost ready to give in to a buying impulse for the 924, but i\ndecided to stop by my insurance agent's office on the way.  I asked\nabout what would happen to my rate with either car.\n \n\"If you buy the Supra, your rate classification will be the same as\nthe Celica (the '85 Celica was considered a subcompact and for that\nyear was rated as one of the safest cars), with a slight increase because\nthe car will be 2 years newer.  Our lower-risk division will continue\nto handle your account.\n \n\"If you buy the Porsche 924, we'll have to change you to the standard\n[higher] rate company and your rate will double.  And if you go with\na 944, it's another story again - we'll cover the rest of this year,\nbut cancel you after that.\"\n \n\"But the Supra is much faster than the 924, and the 924 is actually\nfaster than the [standard] 944.  That doens't make sense.\"\n \n That's what the book says.  We don't insure Corvettes, either.  For\nsome reason, the underwriters consider Supras - and their drivers -\nas very traditional and conservative.\"\n \nI eventually went with the Supra for a number of reasons.  The Porsche\ndealer had a nice salesman to get me interested, but a tough high-pressure\nguy in the back room.  At equal monthly payments, it would have taken\na year longer to pay for the Porsche, plus its higher insurance.  I\nconcluded that the high insurance was related to probability of auto\ntheft.\n \n   /|/| /||)|/  /~ /\\| |\\|)[~|)/~   |   Everyone's entitled to MY opinion.\n  / | |/ ||\\|\\  \\_|\\/|_|/|)[_|\\\\_|  |      goldberg@oasys.dt.navy.mil\n========Imagination is more important than knowledge. - Albert Einstein=======\n \n \n \n \n \n======================================================================== 32\n \nI live in Idaho.

The problem,\nthough, as i saw it, was not their fault for barreling around me, but my fault\nfor not paying the attention to my task-at-hand that i should have been.\nOddly enough, since the 2nd time(happened 2x in around 4 mo. when i'd had my\nliscence for around 6 mo), i haven't been startled..and i've been passed by\ncars doing roughly twice the speed of my car.  Another odd occurance is the\nfact that this only seems to happen on LONG trips...and if i drive along with\nthem, it doesn't happen at all :-) even on the long trips! :-)  (adrenaline\nwill do that to you...i've had bad cop experiences with speeding, so anything\nover the limit is adrenalizing for me...scared i'll get caught :-)  Maybe\nthey should raise the limit, so we can pay better attention.....\n\njust curious, and my .otwo\n\nDREW\n</td><td>7</td><td>rec.autos</td></tr><tr><td>From: ciarlett@mizar.usc.edu (Joni Ciarletta)\nSubject: Master Cylinder\nOrganization: University of Southern California, Los Angeles, CA\nLines: 10\nDistribution: world\nNNTP-Posting-Host: mizar.usc.edu\n\n\nThanks to everyone who responded to my Honda Accord break question.\nIt does seem that the master cylinder is bad.

The\npull-off, which is vacuum actuated, provides a necessary pull in non-cold\nweather conditions to get the idle off the the fast idle cam. Locate the\nfast idle cam on your vehicle and see if you can rotate it to produce a\nnormal idle. If so, locate the diaphram and test it. If you can't apply\nsuction (via a good piece of rubber vacuum hose) with your mouth that will\ncause the diaphram to retract, then it's bad and should be replaced.\n\nBernie Lofaso\nApplied Research Labs\n</td><td>7</td><td>rec.autos</td></tr><tr><td>From: boyle@cactus.org (Craig Boyle)\nSubject: Re: Looking to buy Dodge Stealth, have questions\nKeywords: questions\nArticle-I.D.: cactus.1993Apr6.041810.17295\nOrganization: Capital Area Central Texas UNIX Society, Austin, Tx\nLines: 88\n\nIn article <1993Apr5.203719@usho0b.hou281.chevron.com> hhtra@usho0b.hou281.chevron.com (T.M.Haddock) writes:\n>In article <1993Apr2.030031.15691@cactus.org>, boyle@cactus.org (Craig Boyle) writes:\n>|> In article <1993Apr1.104746@usho72.hou281.chevron.com> hhtra@usho72.hou281.chevron.com (T.M.Haddock) writes:\n>\n> I found a Mopar spec sheet this weekend:\n\n>\n>               model         wgt    hp\n>             Stealth         3086   164\n>             Stealth ES      3186   222\n>             Stealth RT      3373   222\n>             Stealth RT TT   3803   300\n>\n> Okay, I'll take \"their\" word for it.\n\nThese arethe numbers I have been stating in the past 5-10 messages.

If they get caught, there is no punishment\n at all.  In the old days such behaviour would be rewarded with a whipping\n with a good-sized belt, and then taken into some hospital to see first hand\n what kind of damage such accidents cause.   Of course this doesn't happen\n any more.  That whipping would probably save the kid's life by teaching\n him some respect for others.  A person with that little respect would\n inevitably wind up dead early anyway.\n\n   The problem is creeping gradualism.  If you put a frog into hot water,\n he just jumps out.  But if you put him into cold water and then ever-so-\n gradually heat it, the frog will cook.

It should not be presumed from the existence\nof this group that it is appropriate to create many groups to cover many\ndifferent marques; groups specific to individual marques should only be\ncreated on demonstration of sufficient interest, via some avenue such as\na mailing list.\n\nrec.audio.car\n\nis not properly part of the rec.autos.* hierarchy.  it is, however,\nthe correct place for discussion of automotive audio equipment, and\nso is mentioned here.\n\nrec.autos.antique\n\nis intended for the discussion of older cars (usually more than 25 years\nold, although this is not a hard-and-fast rule.)\n\nalt.hotrod\n\nis not part of the hierarchy, but also of potential interest to the\nrec.autos reader.  it is gatewayed to the moderated hotrod mailing\nlist, and is for serious discussion of modifying and developing\nperformance vehicles.\n\nalt.autos.rod-n-custom\n\nalso not part of the `official' hierarchy; devoted to that peculiar\nAmerican hobby of customizing older cars.\n\nalt.autos.karting\n\nfor the discussion of the popular motorsport and hobby, karting.\n\nrec.autos\n\nis intended to capture discussion on all other automotive topics.\n\n\nCrossposting:\n\nCrossposting occurs when more than one newsgroup name is included on\nthe Newsgroups: line in the article header; such articles will appear\nin all of the newsgroups listed.\n\nCrossposting is one of the most misunderstood and misused facilities on\nUsenet.  You should only post to a group because you feel an article is\nappropriate; you should NEVER crosspost just to reach a particular\naudience.  This distinction is subtle, but important.  Radar Detector\narticles, for example, are more-or-less appropriate in rec.autos.  They are\nalmost never appropriate in sci.electronics or rec.ham-radio, and the fact\nthat you might want to reach the audience in sci.electronics or\nrec.ham-radio is NOT adequate justification for posting to either group.\n\nCrossposting between any or all of the rec.autos.* groups is usually\ninappropriate; if you find yourself doing so, consider whether or not it is\ntruly advisable, before sending your article.  Consider setting Followup-To:\nto point to only one newsgroup if you feel you must crosspost.\n\nCrossposting between rec.autos.* and misc.consumers is chancy at best; in\nparticular flame wars over the speed limit in the US and/or the use of\nradar detectors should NEVER be crossposted between any of these groups.\n\nMost readers of sci.electronics and rec.radio.* couldn't care less about\nthe police radar and radar detector arguments that go on endlessly in\nrec.autos.\n\nIt is an excellent idea to check the Newsgroups: and Followup-to:  lines of\narticles before posting a followup.  In particular, be wary of posting to\nmisc.test, rec.arts.startrek.*, or talk.bizarre, or any combination of these\nthree.  The life you save may be your own.\n\nDistribution:\n\nThere is a field in the header of any news article which allows you to\n(partially) control where the article goes; it is called the Distribution\nfield.  It may be very useful for many reasons; it should also serve\nas a reminder that news is a very large and widespread system.\n\nThe distribution of rec.autos.* is fairly extensive.  As of this writing, \nthe Automotive newsgroups are known to reach most of Europe, Australia,\nNew Zealand, and some locations in Japan.  With this in mind, I offer the\nfollowing hints about use of the Distribution: field in your article\nheaders, and on article content.\n\n1) Please take care not to send for-sale ads about clapped out Ford\nMavericks in New Jersey to France or California; i doubt that anyone in\neither place will care, except for my girlfriend, who for some strange\nreason likes Mavericks (but only 4-door Mavericks, at that.)\n\n2) When posting technical questions, please include the market for which\nyour car was manufactured.  For example, there are a number of differences\nbetween a European-market Ford Escort and a US-market Escort.  Likewise,\nall 1750cc and early 2000cc Alfa Romeos reached the US with Spica Fuel\ninjection; European market cars usually got carbs (often Webers).  These\ndifferences can be important to your readers; make your situation clear.\nFailure to do so can lead to pointless flame wars and a significant\nspread of misinformation.\n\n3) Be careful about your capacities and specifications when posting;\nin the US we get a mix of Metric and English system values, whereas\nEurope is almost entirely on the Metric system.  A future edition\nof this monthly posting will contain a list of commonly-used\nabbreviations that may not be known in some places that rec.autos\nreaches; this cuts both ways so let us not be parochial about it.\n\n4) Use the Distribution: field to limit where your article goes, when\npossible.  Within North America, the values na (north america), can\n(canada), and usa may be used.  in addition, the two-letter state\nabbreviations of the US are supported in some cases; e.g. if i wanted\nto send an article only to New York and New Jersey, i could put\n\"ny,nj\" in a Distribution field.  note that multiple, comma-separated\nvalues are legal.  these distribution fields vary widely, however, so\nyou should check with your local sysadmin to find out what is likely\nto be supported in your area.\n\nThe Dangers of Overgeneralization:\n\nTo amplify a warning from the distribution section of this article:\nBe wary of making foolish assumptions about all cars, tires, etc.  What is\ntrue for a 1973 Buick with a 455cid engine may be quite utterly wrong for a\n1976 Honda with a 1200cc engine.  Headlight laws in Sweden are decidedly\ndifferent from those in Idaho.\n\nThe Need for Adequate Specification:\n\nWhen you ask a question, please give a reasonable amount of information;\ne.g., if you have a question about your Honda, please specify year,\nmodel, engine size, etc.  Otherwise, most answers to your question may be\nquite useless.\n\n\nConcerning Lemons:\n\nAt one time or another, every auto manufacturer has manufactured a lemon or\ntwo; even Honda admits to this.  Please don't waste everyone's time by\nannouncing to the world that your `brand x' automobile is terrible, so all\n`brand x' automobiles are terrible, so no one should ever buy a car from\nthe `brand x' company.  Such articles are worse than useless, because they\ncause substantial wasted bandwidth while carrying little or no useful\ninformation.\n\n\nConcerning Flames:\n\nAs much as we might wish it, a flame-free newsgroup is something that most\nlikely will never occur.  Here are some guidelines for flames and how\nto deal with them (a list of flame-prone topics follows in the next section\nof this posting):\n\nIf you post something truly obnoxious and inflammatory, don't imagine for a\nminute that including the words `No Flames' will work.  It won't, and\nyou'll get exactly what you deserve.\n\nIf you're going to flame, you're more likely to get away with it if you can\ncite a fact or maybe a well-known reference.  No one is likely to believe\nbald, unsupported assertions.\n\nBe careful about who you choose to insult.  Consider not insulting anyone.\n\n\nAsking the Question:\n\nIt is a bad idea to post a question and end it with a phrase like `Please\nsend email, I don't read this group'.  It is a much better idea to\nend the question with `Please send email, if there is sufficient interest\nI'll summarize the results in a later posting.  I may miss posted responses\nto this request'.\n\nAnswering the Question:\n\nIf someone wants to hop up their Yugo, don't tell them to get a Mustang.\nEither be silent, or give them useful advice.  If someone wants advice on\ndefending a speeding ticket, don't tell them to obey the law next time --\nit's offensive, presumes guilt which is not proven, and doesn't directly\naddress the original question.  In general, don't post in order to see\nyour words in print, and don't post in order to enjoy feeling smug and\nself-righteous.\n\n\nStale and/or Inflammatory Topics:\n\nCertain topics are considered stale by `old timers'; while discussion of\nthem is certainly ok, and new, factual information is welcome, ravings\nabout them are extremely tiresome, and may get the person who posts them\nignored altogether.  Some topics are naturally inflammatory; it is\ndifficult if not impossible to have meaningful discussion of them.  Some\nof these topics include the following:\n\n1)  the 55mph speed limit in the US: Pro and Con\n\n2)  discussions about the morality and legality of the sale and usage of\n    radar detectors.\n\n3)  discussions over which radar detector is best.\n\n4)  discussions over what is a sports car (this is one reason why\n    rec.autos.sport is not a `sports car' group -- everyone would argue\n    about what constitutes a `sports car'.)\n\n5)  disputes over whether or not US Federal law protects the driver's\n    right to own and operate a radar detector\n\n6)  `Buy American' discussions\n\n7)  `clever' bumper stickers and personalized license plates\n\n8)  <insert nationality here> cars are terrible\n\n9)  What kind of car did Maxwell Smart drive?\n      [when I have a complete, accurate answer it will be added to the\n          commonly-asked questions article which is also posted monthly.\n          Until then, please don't waste bandwidth on this topic. -- rpw]\n\n\n\nPlease direct comments and suggestions about this article to:\n\n     welty@cabot.balltown.cma.com\n-- \nrichard welty        518-393-7228       welty@cabot.balltown.cma.com\n``Nothing good has ever been reported about the full rotation of\n  a race car about either its pitch or roll axis''  -- Carroll Smith\n</td><td>7</td><td>rec.autos</td></tr><tr><td>From: tcorkum@bnr.ca (Trevor Corkum)\nSubject: Is car saftey important? \nNntp-Posting-Host: 47.141.0.88\nReply-To: tcorkum@bnr.ca (Trevor Corkum)\nOrganization: Bell-Northern Research Ltd.\nLines: 11\n\n   I was recently thumbing through the 1993 Lemon-Aid New\nCar Guide.

The SAE numbers are based on a `typical'\ncurve that oils used to all have, running from (say) the viscosity of a\nroom-temperature 90-weight at 0C, down to (say) that of a room-temperature \n5-weight at 20C, for a typical 40-weight oil.\n\nOils that are designed for operation in `normal' temperatures just have\na weight specification.  Oils that are designed for operation in exceedingly\ncold temperatures have a `W' tacked on the end, so in winter in a cold\nplace, you'd stick 10W in your car in the winter and 40 in it in the summer,\nto approximate the appropriate viscosity throughout the year.\n\nModern multi-viscosity oils change viscosity much less with temperature.\nAs a result, their viscosity graphs cross over several curves.  A multi-vis\nspecification pegs the curve at two temperatures, a `normal' operating\ntemperature and a `cold' one (though I can't remember the numbers...).\n\nIn any event, the weights do indicate a significant difference.  Remember\nthat your engine is temperature-regulated (by the thermostat and\nradiator or air fins) most of the time -- unless you overheat it or\nsomething.\n\nAny weight of oil is better than no oil, or than very old, carbonized\noil.

An on-the-road rally where participants are given a set of\n      directions and clues guiding participates around the \n      Joliet/Plainfield area.  The object is to navigate a course\n      based on a set of directions and clues.  Participants will\n      be given a set of questions pertaining to the course which\n      they must answer along the way.  Points are awarded for the\n      number of correct answers given.  Directions will ultimately \n      lead to an off-road area where a four-wheel drive course is \n      set-up.  At various locations in the on-road course, check-points\n      will be set-up where participants will be asked other questions\n      or requested to perform some activity (e.g. tire roll, truck tow,\n      basketball free-throw, etc.) for additional points.\n\n   2. An optional off-road, four wheel drive course where participants\n      will navigate off-road trails, mud bogs and/or hill climbs.\n      Points are awarded for successfully navigating off-road obstacles\n      without getting stuck.  If you should get stuck (which is half\n      the fun anyway), there will be assistance to get your vehicle\n      unstuck so you can try it again.  The off-road course will\n      divided up based on tire size, so stock 4x4s as well as modified\n      4x4s can run the course.\n     \n  At the end of the rally, trophies will be awarded to top scoring\n  participants.  Door prizes and dash plaques will also be given out.\n  Food and drinks also available at the conclusion.\n\n* This is an organized activity sponsored by the Joliet Mud Turtles\n  so safety and fun is our foremost concern.  All 4x4s must be\n  street legal and have solid tow points for the off-road section\n  of the course - we don't want to have to separate someone's bumper\n  from their vehicle :) .\n\nThe Particulars:\n\n* Rally begins at Instant Replay, 2409 Plainfield Road, Joliet Il.\n    (815)436-9382   (see map below)\n* Registration is between 9 and 10:30 a.m.  First truck out at 10:00 a.m.\n* Rally date is Sunday April 25th, rain or shine\n* There is an entry fee of $10 per truck.\n* You must have a co-driver (passengers allowed)\n* A valid drivers license is required\n* Suggested equipment:\n      CB Radio\n      Compass\n      Tow Strap and Clevis\n      Clip Board and Pencil\n* No alcohol during rally\n* For more information contact\n   Gary (815)727-3415\n   Tom  (815)485-9346\n   Norm Jr. (815)741-4853\n   Brian (708)979-6083\n\n\n                                            __\n              Instant                      /\\\n      |       Replay |             |         \\\n      | 1.9mi  ___   | 1.2 mi      |        North\n      |<----->|   | <------------> |\n Rt30 |       |___|  |             |\n------|---------------------------------------------\n Exit |              |             |         ^\n 257  |              |             |         |\n      |              |             |         |\n      |Rt55          |Canton       |Larkin   |\n      |              |Farm         |Ave      |\n      |              |Rd.          |         | 3 mi.\n      |              |             |         |\n      |              |             |         |\n      |                            |         |\n      |                            |         |\n      |       Rt80                 |         v\n----------------------------------------------------\n      |                            | Exit\n      |                            | 130B\n      |                            |\n   \n</td><td>7</td><td>rec.autos</td></tr><tr><td>From: jsmith@cs.dal.ca (Jeff Smith)\nSubject: Header for 89' Honda Civic Si\nOrganization: Math, Stats & CS, Dalhousie University, Halifax, NS, Canada\nLines: 22\nNntp-Posting-Host: cs.dal.ca\n\nHello,\n\tI am looking to slightly increase the performance of my 89 Honda\nCivic Si.

Just a strut\ngoing down to a lower control arm (single bushing: not an A-arm), with a\ntension/compression rod locating it in the forward/backward direction?\n\n\tAnyway, simple strut suspensions like this can be lowered just by using\nshorter springs, cutting the springs, lowering the spring perch or shortening\nthe strut below the perch.  In each of these cases, the suspension geometry\nwill suffer because the lower control arms will not be at the\nintended angle.  A spacer placed between control arm and the bottom\nof the strut (roughly the height of the reduction) will restore\nthe suspension geometry.

I have no idea how either of my Hondas will handle at 100+ mph,\nnor do they reach 155. However, using `high' to be 70-90 mph:\n\na) They are quite amenable to long high speed drives. I've done several\n1k mile+ trips in my Civic with no problems whatsoever. The last big trip\nI made was driving from New York to Texas. I remember driving 700-800\nmiles a day at typically 75-85 mph  without any problems. I'm sure I  \nwould have been more comfortable driving a benz, but no white knuckles.\nNo problems with winds and curves. \n\nThen there was the trip back from New Orleans after Mardi Gras - where\nwe were doing 80+ all the way to Houston. No problems.\n\nb) Both my cars have surprising good fuel economy at high speeds. I see\nno difference between sustained 60 mph and sustained 80mph. On the trip\nback from New Orleans, we got about 30 mpg in my Integra, quite ok. Mind\nyou, the engine revs to almost 4k at 80. The civic is markedly better\nthan the Integra in fuel economy. 50k miles down the road, I still\nget 35 mpg at 70-75 mph driving.\n\n\n>|> b) I can't understand why these high-scale European marquees are afraid\n>|>    to design engines that can be repeatedly revved to near redline in\n>|>    the low gears.

In two weeks I will be returning to Texas (my\nhome) from my school (BYU) in Provo, Utah.  As you can imagine, trying to\ndrive nearly 1300 miles with a broken right ankle isn't just the epitome of\na good time.  My car does not have a cruise control, so I would have to do\nall the pedalling (ha ha) with my messed-up ankle.\n\nMy question:\nWhat is the general opinion of after-market cruise control units?  I\nrealize that a cheap CC (cruise control) from, say, Pep Boys, isn't going to\nbe as good as a factory or professionally installed unit (if there is such a\nthing).  And I uderstand that I probably can't expect much in the way of\naccuracy, looks and that sort of thing;  But anything's gotta be better than\ntrying to drive with a hosed ankle.\n\nI have a 1984 Jeep Cherokee, 4 speed, standard, 4*4, 2.5L engine with\nkettering(sp?) ignition (y'know, distributor cap, rotor, that set-up--not\nelectronic.  Maybe you could've guessed it being an '84, but I'm just trying\nto give information as completly as I can).\n\nI found a CC unit for 80 bucks.  It seems to use the vehicles vacuum system \ninstead of an electric servor/motor.  Is this good or bad?  If I did buy\nthis CC, which vacuum hose should I tap?\n\nIt has two speed sensors:  One magnetic, and one that gets a signal from the \nnegative side of the distributor, kinda like a tach pick-up, or so I\nunderstand.  I can use either one.  Which is best?  The manual says (I read\nit in the store today) that the magnetic/axle set-up is more accurate, but\nharder to install.  Is there really a big difference?\n\nIt has a sensor for the brake pedal, just like other CCs, but does NOT have a\nsensor for the clutch pedal.  So if I wasn't paying real close attention I\nmight push the clutch in while the cruise is trying to get the speed up.  Which\nwould wind the engine up kinda high until I got my wits about me and turned \nthe thing off.  I'm pretty coordinated, so this doesn't bother me, if it\nwere for my girlfriends car, *then* it would bother me, but I'm ok with it.\n\nThe installation also calls for an attachment to a steady-on brake signal\nand a switched-on brake signal.  I think I can get a switched brake signal\nfrom the correct side of the brake light blade fuse.  Am I right?  But I'm\nnot sure where to get the steady-on brake signal, or, for that matter, what\nexactly it is?  Any ideas as to what the manufaturer wants and where to get\nit?\n\nI think I can figure the other things out.  Like how to hook-up the negative\nside tach-type sensing gizmo and the cabin control unit, and the ground and\nall that miscellaneous business.  But I need a little help with:\n\n\t1.  Is it worth the money and safety risk (if any) for such a\n\t    device?\n\t2.  Is there any particularly good after-market CC?\n\t3.  Are \"professionally\" installed CCs signifacantly better and\n\t    worth the cabbage?\n\t4.  If the unit I saw (sorry, no manufacturer or model number, just\n\t    that it is at Pep Boy and its $80) is sufficient for my simple \n\t    needs, how do I get the thing installed properly (specifically,\n\t    the questions above)?\n\nMy father and I built a \"Veep\" (Volkswagen powered Jeep CJ-2A) when I was in\nhigh school, so I consider myself fairly good with tools, electronics, and\ncars.  So the installation doesn't scare me.  I just want to be certain that\nI get the thing installed correctly as my Cherokee is just a wee bit more\ncomplicated than my Veep. :-)\n\nI appreciate your time in reading my post, and I would appreciate any\nexpertise or opinion anybody has on the subject.  If you would like to share\nsome of your wisdom, please email as I don't get over this group very often\n(but I check my mail all the time).\n\nAgain, thanks for any help anyone may have.\n\nMike Wieda\nMikew@canc.byu.edu\n\n</td><td>7</td><td>rec.autos</td></tr><tr><td>From: hkon@athena.mit.edu (Henry Kon)\nSubject: 83 tercel sunroof leaks - arrggh\nOrganization: Massachusetts Institute of Technology\nLines: 14\nDistribution: world\nNNTP-Posting-Host: e40-008-11.mit.edu\n\nIS there a simple way tooput these sunroofs out of their misery - \ndo leaks tend to be from old gaskets ?  \nor from inadequate mechanical seals - \nor all of the above ??\n\nis there any way to halt the rain ?\n\nthanks\nhk\n--\nHenry Bruno Kon\noffice: 617-253-2781 (with machine)\nhome:   617-625-3972 (with machine)\n\n</td><td>7</td><td>rec.autos</td></tr><tr><td>From: smith@ctron.com (Lawrence C Smith)\nSubject: Re: MR2 - noisy engine.\nOrganization: Cabletron Systems, Inc.\nLines: 16\nDistribution: world\nReply-To: smith@ctron.com\nNNTP-Posting-Host: glinda.ctron.com\n\nIn article <Apr21.053718.19765@engr.washington.edu>, eliot@lanmola.engr.washington.edu (eliot) writes:\n\n>if the noise really bugs you, there is nothing else that you can do\n>except to sell it and get a V6.\n\nPerhaps a nice used '88 Pontiac Fiero GT?  2.8 liters.\n\nDoes anyone know if the motor mounts for the 2.8 and the twin-dual-cam 3.4\nliter match?

My 1975 Saab 99\ndidn't have them, but a friend's 1978 Saab 99 certainly did.  In addition\nto the confentional tail-light mounted backup lights, they had another\nset integrated into the front turn signal assembly.  For those of you who\ndon't remember, Saabs of that vintage had an enormous multicoloured plastic\ngrowth, about the size of a _National Geographic_ magazine, sticking out\nof the front fender, which incorporated amber \"parking lights\", amber side\nmarker lights/reflectors, white \"cornering lamps\" (like American luxury\ncars) aimed towards the side of the road when you have your turn indicators\non, and white \"backup lights\" aimed towards the back of the car when you\nhave selected reverse gear.  The glossy brochure showed how these front\nmounted backup lights were useful for illuminating hazards (pot holes, kid's\ntoys, etc) that would be run over by the front of the car if you had the\nwheels turned while backing up.\n\nMart L.

The problem is that the car has \naftermarket tint on all windows except the windshield. The tint is rather\nweak, and you can clearly see the inside of the car through the tint.\n\nThe inspection garage said that they won't pass it unless I get a\nwaiver from the state police. So I went to the state police - the\nofficer told me that aftermarket tint is illegal, and I can get a\nwaiver only for a pre-84 car or for a medical reason. I asked him to\nshow me the section of the vehicle code that says it's illegal.  He\nshowed it to me and the paraghaph said that you can't have tint, if\nyou can't see the inside of the car because of the tint. When I told\nhim that you can in fact see the inside very well, he shut the book\nand said \"It's just illegal, and in fact we can have someone give you\na ticket for it right now.\" Well, won't argue with that...\n\nSince the vehicle code says it's OK as long as you can see through the\ntint, I'd like to keep it (I'll re-read the vehicle code in the\nlibrary).  I'd also like to get some sort of paper from the police\nthat says it's OK, so I can get the inspection, and so that I won't\nget in trouble for the tint later on. I also wouldn't mind registering\na complaint against that officer - he really pissed me off.\n\nSo does anyone have any experience getting that sort of a paper from\nthe police, especially in Pennsylvania? Does anyone have any experience\nregistering a complaint against an officer? I called the station \nlater on today, but they basically said there is no place where I\ncould register a complaint against an officer... And if I do decide\nto keep the tint and get a ticket anyway, how much of a chance do\nI stand to succesfully appeal the ticket in court?\n\nAny comments about it will be welcome!\n\nMichal\n\n</td><td>7</td><td>rec.autos</td></tr><tr><td>From: marshatt@feserve.cc.purdue.edu (Zauberer)\nSubject: Re: WARNING.....(please read)...\nOrganization: Purdue University\n \n Can we please stick to AUTOMOTIVE topics .

I don't care if there are going to\nreform their dealers/service with the intro of the LH cars, I will believe\nit when I see it.  Case and point, the local dodge dealer.  You drive up,\njust looking, you don't even get out of your door, when about 10 (yes 10)\nsalesman all eye you like their next meal, and literally pounce on you,\nand try to get you to make a deal, on everything your eye wanders towards.\nService is about 2 times worse than that.  I had an alignment problem, but\nthey tried to tell me that the K frame was bent, and about 2000 dollars of\nwork/parts to fix it.  Let me tell you the problems I had, and I took care\nof this car, I put alot of miles on it in the first couple years, but took\nit to every checkup it needed, and many that shouldn't have been.\n\n1988 Dodge Shadow ES\n\nThese were replaced within the 4 years that I owned the car.\n\nEngine \n4 Alternators\nRear Suspension Torsion Bar\n2 Water pumps\n5 thermostats\nHall effect sensor\nMain computer\n4 Batteries\n\nThese were rebuilt/repaired\n\nRadiator\nAutomatic Transmission\nPower Steering\n\n\nThose are just the things I can remember off the top of my head.  For\nabout a year before I sold the car, I said to myself, it's a good car, I\njust can't find anybody competent enough the fix it.  In the end, before I\ntraded it in for a Saturn, the power steering started acting up again.  I\njust stopped putting money into it.  I must have put at least $5000-$7000\nworth of repairs over it's lifetime.  I am sorry but Lee Iacocca can bite\nme.  Bullshit, whoever backs em best, is just afraid the stupid things are\ngoing to fall apart, and no one will buy them without assurance, why the\nhell do you think that LH has been nicknamed Last Hope.\n\nYou can do better, and I know people will disagree with me here, but\nJapanese, like Honda, or Toyota, or the only american car company that I\nfeel is a quality product, Saturn.  I will not touch another chrysler\nproduct again, no way.  I don't care how good the LH cars look good, and I\nwill admit they look promising, but not with the support that you get.  GM\nisn't much better, thank god, they don't control Saturn, like they do\ntheir divisions, or it would be just another marketing ploy.  \n\nDon't get me wrong, i will be watching my car (which I do like) like a\nhawk for the next 4 years.  I am much more hesitant to say it (or any) car\nis really good, until it has proved itself to me.\n\nBut since someone else pointed out C&D as a source.  I will note, because\nI used to read these magazines, that Car and Driver has never had a good\nthing to say about most Chrysler products (Shadow for one), always were\nthey moaning about the reguritated K-car, and engine.  Whereas Motor Trend\nalways thought they were great cars.  No car magazine is really objective.\n\nAnd although there are alot of people who don't like Consumers Reports, I\nwill use them to reinforce my argument (I already know about the big stink\nwith the Saturn crash tests, time will tell how good a car they are), the\nshadow/sundance rate much worse than average, in fact none of the\nchrysler's rate a better than average, I think the best one is just\naverage.  Excluding the diamond star/mitsubishi stuff and the LH's.  You\ncan find bad stuff about the Shadow.  Try as I might, when I researched\nthe Saturn, I could not find anything bad about it.  There is a great deal\nof information about this company, just because it is a new american\ncompany and it has created quite a stir in the automotive community, for\ngood reason.  Much more than the introduction of any new model lines of\nany established company.  I read an article, which had a sub-column, an I\nthink this imprinted on me more than anything else.  Some big wig in\nToyota said and I quote, \"We are watching them very closely.\"  Come on,\neverybody grow up, the foreign cars, especially the japanese have been\nkicking our butts, for good reason, the american car companies could not make\na good product or support the customer the way they want these days, to\nset in their ways, which is one of the reasons Saturn was created.  They\nare still struggling because they haven't learned yet.  They have the\nability, the workers are not inferior, the technology is not out of date,\nbut their attitude is, and they are just finding this out.

Your problem in the wet is call hydroplaning.\nYou may not have enough tread left to channel water out from under the\ntire - so it goes fishy on you as it lifts off the road.\n\n(2) Tires age. In particular, soft tire compounds get harder as you put\nthem thru more heat cycles. Harder compounds don't grip as well as\nsoft ones.

You can get into a 3.0 L v-6 (141 hp) Shadow for $10~11K (the I-4  \nturbo a bit more), and a droptop for $14~15K.  \n\n\n</td><td>7</td><td>rec.autos</td></tr><tr><td>From: kensib@cary112.its.rpi.edu (Brian C.

It's only been in the last\nyear or two that airbags have become a significant selling feature.\nVW assumed that  automatic belts would satisfy govt. requirements for\npassive restraint, but didn't guess that the 'merican consumer would\nactually make buy decisions based on the presence of an airbag.\n\nVW is really hurting right now in the US market.

As per normal VW practice, the US\nlaunch of the Jetta III is delayed again and again, until a good chunk\nof the useful life of the design is spent.\n\nI think that Passats come from Germany, so there is not the same\nquality and availability issue.

A good used car buy.\nThe MX-6 was almost there but rolled more than I liked.  \nI didn't like the Prelude dash/instrumentation at all.  Too weird for me.\nThe MR2 has a much smaller non-passenger space than I needed, so out that went.\nThe Celica was \"ok\" but underpowered when loaded with options (and somewhat\noverpriced too) in non-turbo form.\nI never considered the 240SX since it didn't have an airbag.  I did look at it\nfor its RWD virtues but that's it.  The Corolla never entered my mind.\nI should have looked at the Mitsubishi VR4/Dodge Stealth more.\nSince my list was exhausted, I bought the Probe.  :-)\n\nThe car design is different than earlier years, so it's too early to see its\nreliability so far.  For what it's worth, my comments:\n\nMy dislikes:\nShutting door with windows up from inside rarely makes good wind seal.\nHeadlights have \"stuck\" up a few times (weather?)\nair conditioning broke ~4000 miles (pressure cycling switch)\ncondensation around rear washer fluid container doesn't drain completely.\ncrammed engine; little hope for do-it-yourselfers (typical)\nparts somewhat more expensive than normal Ford parts\nunderside plastic doesn't like sharp driveways and speedbumps (typical).\nassembly gripes: tape on radiator, screw fell out of dash, seat seams not \nstitched properly.  Hopefully just a fluke.\nFord only gives 1 key with the car.  C'mon Ford, spend an extra few pennies!\nRear hatch has no padding on corners when up.  I'm waiting for the day when\nI bash my head on the corner.\nhorn buttons behind air bag in spokes and not in center (personal preference)\nTires fling dirt/mud onto side of car \n\nMy Likes:\nengine (design/valves/sounds/smoothness/power/mileage/torque) -- definitely #1\nhandling (very good for FWD; understeer only at limits)\ntransmission (the 5 speed is a must)\nusable instrumentation (lovely readable analog everywhere)\nVery little torque steer at full power (much better than the '90 SHO I drive)\nstability at 100+mph (high gearing though)\nlow cowl (good visibility in front)\nHeated outside mirrors (nice in fog, never tested in freezing weather)\nABS/Air bag (see above)\nrear seats fold down (I have few rear seat passengers so a trunk not important)\nNo shake/rattle noises when going over bumps/potholes (still!)\nTires: 225/55VR16 Goodyear Eagles (70% left; hoping for 30K :-)\n\nAs you can see, I'm primarily interested in the engine.  While it doesn't\nhave the uummmph of a big-liter car or the turbo rush, the big selling\npoint for me was the all-aluminum 24 value 2.5 liter engine.  \n\nThe overall car is a good buy for the money.  That market segment hasn't changed\nmuch since July (Prelude VTEC, Honda Del Sol??).  I drive it to and from work\neach day on relatively smooth roads, and most noticable thing is that the\nProbe's suspension doesn't like potholes.  When you test drive one, find a \npotholed road somewhere around town and see if the jarring you get is tolerable.\nIf you have 3+ passengers, by all means bring them along too.  They'll find\nthat they have no room in the back and you'll find that the car rides\ndifferently (if that's \"better\" is up to you).  Also, there's a lot of glass\naround you which I wasn't expecting; the temperature inside the car gets pretty\nhot in the summer.  My back seat passengers (now very few) complain about\nthe lack of ventilation; you may want to consider that when combined with\nthe heat.  I've heard that the exhaust system has trouble, but mine works fine.\nLeather and the keyless entry system weren't available when I got the car so\nI can't comment on them (I got the car before it was officially announced).  \nI prefer cloth to leather anyway.  \n\nI wouldn't want this car in the snow:  The suspension is too rough for the\ninevitable surprise potholes, tires aren't meant for snow, and the seats assume\nthat you're not wearing lots of thick clothing.  Rain is much better:  water \ngenerally beads off the windshield at freeway speed, the windshield wiper\ncontrols are easy and understandable, and I barely hydroplaned once with the\nEagles (and I was really trying).  \nThere is also a definite lack of cup holder/small storage places.  The GT\nhas map holders below the speakers in the door, but they're rigid plastic\nthat could fit two cassettes or CD's max.

But the demonstration of this\nproduct really impressive, if it didn't cheat.\n\nThe setup of the demo is fairly simple. A cone shaped rotor is\nhalf submerged in a small oil sink, filled with motor oil. The rotor\nis powered by an electronic motor. A metal pad is pressed against\nthe rotor using the torque wrench until the rotor stopped by friction. \nThe torque that is needed to stop rotor is read from the torque wrench.\n\nBefore MILITECH was added, the rotor was stopped with about 60 lb-ft\nof torque (You pick the brand of oil, no difference). Once MILITECH was \nadded to the oil, the rotor could not be stopped even with 120+ lb-ft of\ntorque. \n\nHere is the good part: even after the salesman emptied the oil sink, \nyou still could not stopped the rotor with the thin film remained  on it.\n\nThey say you need only add 2oz per quart of oil every 15k miles. A 16 oz\nbottle is $25.\n\nI still have my doubts. If this product is really so great, why it was\nso little known? The salesman said it is widely used in military. I didn't\nbelieve it.  The demo was so impressive, that I bought a bottle against\nmy common sense.\n\nHas anyone heard of or actually used this product? Is it real?\nIf you are going to the auto show, please visit this stand on the \nsecond floor. See if can find out if the demo is a hoax or not.\n\nJason Chen\n\n</td><td>7</td><td>rec.autos</td></tr><tr><td>From: rmt6r@faraday.clas.Virginia.EDU (Roy Matthew Thigpen)\nSubject: (w)rec.autos\nOrganization: University of Virginia\nLines: 3\n\n\nThere is just something disconcerting about the name of this group. :)\n\n</td><td>7</td><td>rec.autos</td></tr><tr><td>From: mcostell@oasys.dt.navy.mil (Malcolm G.

New York prohibits their use in\n    large trucks.  In Canada, they are illegal in Manitoba, Ontario,\n    Quebec, Newfoundland and PEI (Prince Edward Island).  They\n    are apparently are illegal through most, if not all, of Europe.\n    Legislation which would make them illegal is pending in many other\n    jurisdictions; chances of such legislation passing varies a great deal.\n\nQ:  Where are Radar Detector Detectors used?  Do they really work?\n\nA:  Usage is spreading rapidly; initially they were used only in Canada,\n    but now they are appearing in New York and Virginia.  It is unsafe\n    to assume that they are not in use in Connecticut and D.C.\n    They work by detecting a certain frequency radiated by many currently\n    available super Het radar detectors; some brands of detector radiate\n    more strongly than others, and are thus more likely to be spotted.\n    New radar detectors are becoming available which may not be detected\n    by the current generation of detector detectors.  Note that a\n    detector may only be spotted by one of these devices if it is turned\n    on.\n\nQ:  What is VASCAR?  Is it some kind of Radar?\n\nA:  VASCAR is nothing more than a fancy stopwatch and time-speed-distance\n    computer.  It depends on the operator pressing buttons as the target\n    vehicle passes landmarks.  No radar signals are emitted by a VASCAR\n    system.\n\nQ:  What is Ka band radar?  Where is it used?  Should a radar detector be\n    able to handle it? \n\nA:  Ka band has recently been made available by the FCC for use in the US\n    in so-called photo-radar installations.  In these installations, a\n    low-powered beam is aimed across the road at a 45 degree angle to the\n    direction of traffic, and a picture is taken of vehicles which the\n    radar unit determines to have been in violation of the speed limit.\n    Tickets are mailed to the owner of the vehicle.  Because of the low\n    power and the 45 degree angle, many people believe that a radar\n    detector cannot give reasonable warning of a Ka band radar unit,\n    although some manufacturers of radar detectors have added such\n    capability anyway.  The number of locales where photo-radar is in use\n    is limited, and some question the legality of such units.  Best advice:\n    learn what photo radar units look like, and keep track of where they\n    are used (or else, don't speed.)\n\nQ:  Do radar jammers work?  Are they legal?\n\nA:  Quick answer:  No, and Not in the USA.\n    Detailed answer:  Cheap radar jammers do not work well at all.\n    Jammers that work are expensive and usually the property of the\n    military.  Jammers are a major violation of the regulations of the\n    Federal Communications Commission of the USA.\n\nDriving technique and Vehicle Dynamics Questions:\n\nQ:  What are understeer and oversteer?\n\nA:  Understeer and oversteer are terms describing the behaviour of a\n    car while cornering near the `limit' (limit of adhesion, that is.)\n    Most drivers do not normally drive hard enough for these terms to\n    be descriptive of the situations they encounter.  Simply put, they\n    tell whether the car wants to go straight in a corner (steer `less',\n    or `understeer') or it wants to turn more in a corner (`oversteer'.)\n    Understeer is commonly designed into most production cars so that\n    untrained drivers, inadvertantly traveling too fast, won't get into\n    trouble.  Understeer may also be induced by using too much throttle\n    in a corner.  Oversteer is designed into some more performance\n    oriented cars; it may be induced by lifting on the throttle (Trailing\n    throttle oversteer, or TTO).  In extreme cases, lifting on the throttle\n    may induce so much oversteer that the car reacts by fishtailing or\n    spinning.\n\n    Some technical details:  in a corner at speed, the tires on the car\n    will develop what are called `slip angles'; the slip angle is the\n    angular difference between the direction that the car is traveling\n    and the direction that the steering wheel is directing the car to\n    travel.  In understeer, the front wheels have a greater slip angle\n    than the rear wheels.  In oversteer, the rear wheels have a greater\n    slip angle than the front wheels.\n\nQ: What is a rev-matched downshift?\n\nA: When downshifting, the engine must be rotating faster in the lower gear\n   than it was in the higher gear.  However, during a downshift, normally\n   you declutch and lift your foot from the throttle, so the revs drop\n   rather than increase.  In rev-matched downshift, you blip the throttle\n   before re-engaging the clutch so that the engine will already be up to\n   the new speed.  This results in a much smoother and faster downshift.\n\nQ: What does heel-and-toe mean?\n\nA: Heel-and-toe is a technique used to do a rev-matched downshift while\n   braking.  This is normally challenging, because you need the right foot\n   for both the brake and throttle.  It is called heel-and-toe because you\n   use one end of the foot on the brake, and the other on the throttle to\n   match revs for the downshift.  In many modern cars this is a misnomer;\n   often you must use the ball of the foot on the brake and the right side\n   on the throttle.\n\n   Note that some race car drivers will skip the clutch, and just use the\n   left foot on the brake and the right foot on the throttle, accomplishing\n   the same thing.\n\nQ: What is double-clutch downshifting?\n\nA: While your right foot is doing the above, your left foot can do one of\n   three things:  nothing, declutch once, or declutch twice.  The reason for\n   declutching twice is to match the speeds of the two shafts in the\n   transmission to the speed of the engine.  This is usually coupled with\n   rev-matching, so that while the engine is in neutral and the clutch\n   engaged, the throttle is blipped and both shafts of the transmission\n   speed up.\n\n   The procedure is as follows:\n   (0) declutch\n   (1) move gearshift lever to neutral\n   (2) engage clutch\n   (3) match revs\n   (4) declutch\n   (5) move gearshift lever to next lower gear\n   (6) engage clutch\n\n   This sounds like a lot of work, but with practice it becomes natural.\n   The problem that double-clutching solves is normally the function of the\n   synchronizers within the gearbox.  In transmissions without synchros or\n   with very worn synchros, double-clutching makes it much easier to shift.\n   Basically, if you double-clutch well, you are not using the synchros at\n   all.  This is generally unnecessary on street cars with synchros in good\n   condition.\n\nQ: What do the numbers for acceleration from 0-60, 1/4 mile, skidpad, and\n   slalom times in the Auto Magazines really mean?  May they be compared?\n\nA: In short, 1) not as much as the magazines want you to believe, and\n   2) almost never.\n\n   In more detail:  the acceleration numbers (0-60mph and 1/4 mile times\n   in the US) may be vaguely compared as long as they all come from the\n   same source.  Testing procedures vary so much from magazine to magazine\n   that comparing a Road & Track number to a Car & Driver number is quite\n   pointless.  Keep in mind, too, that the same variation applies from\n   driver to driver on the street; the driver is a major (often *the*\n   major) part of the equation.\n\n   Skidpads vary, and even if they didn't, skidpad figures are really\n   only tests of the stickiness of the stock tires; they change radically\n   when tire compounds change.  DO NOT make any assumptions about the\n   comparative handling of, say, two sports sedans based on skidpad numbers.\n   This is not to suggest that skidpads are without value, however. Skidpads\n   are an excellent educational tool at driving schools.  They are simply\n   of limited value in the comparison of anything except tires.\n\n   Slalom times are slightly more useful; they test some small parts of the\n   automobile's transient response.  However, they are also heavily influenced\n   by the stock rubber on the car, and they do not test many corners of the\n   car's envelope.  They DO NOT tell you all you need to know before making\n   a buying decision.  For example, they don't tell you what the rear end\n   of the car will do on a road which suddenly goes off-camber.  When a car\n   has an adjustable suspension, these tests are usually done in the `sport'\n   setting, which may be quite unsuitable for daily driving.  The list of\n   caveats could go on for page after page.\n\nQ: My buddy claims that wide tires don't make any difference, according\n   to his freshman physics textbook, and that you can't ever accelerate\n   or corner at more than 1.0G.  Does he know what he's talking about?\n\nA: 1) in short:  he hasn't got a clue.\n\n   2) in more detail: the equations for friction used in freshman physics\n   textbooks presume that the surfaces are smooth,  dry and non-deformable,\n   none of which properly apply to tire traction except in the case of a\n   stone cold tire on dry pavement which is far below its proper operating\n   temperature.\n\n   Pavement is _never_ smooth; it is always irregular to a greater or lesser\n   extent.  Tires, which are not really dry and solid (as rubber is a\n   substance which in its natural form is liquid, and which has only been\n   coerced into a semblance of solidity by chemical magic), deform to match\n   the surface of the pavement which a vehicle is traveling over.  In a tire\n   at operating temperature, grip is actually generated by shear stresses\n   inside the deformed rubber, and not by anything even remotely resembling\n   friction in the freshman physics sense of the term.  The colder a tire\n   is relative to its operating temperature, the closer its behaviour will\n   be to the traditional concept of friction; if much hotter than the its\n   proper operating temperature, the more likely the possibility of some\n   part of the tire actually ``reverting'' to liquid, which is mostly like\n   to happen deep in the tread, causing characteristic blisters and chunking.\n   (This latter, though, is almost completely unlikely to happen in normal\n   street driving, so unless you're a competition driver or do a lot of\n   high speed track driving, don't worry about it.)\n\n   Because tire traction is completely out of the domain of simple friction,\n   it does not obey the freshman physics equation at all; thus dragsters\n   accelerate at more than 1.0G and race cars corner and brake at more than\n   1.0G.  Because simple friction does not apply, it is actually possible\n   for different sized contact patches to generate differing amounts of\n   grip.  An actual analysis of tire behavior would require techniques\n   such as Finite Element Analysis, due to the complexity of the mechanism.\n\nMisc.

In particular, NEVER\n    ask in rec.humor if you want a useful result.\n\n    Saab:   Svenska Aeroplan A.

Porsche has extensive business dealings with VW/Audi,\n    which causes some confusion.  Since currently Porsche is in some\n    financial difficulty, there is a possibility that Mercedes or VW may\n    be interested in purchasing the company in the near future, but this\n    is only speculation at this time.\n-- \nrichard welty        518-393-7228       welty@cabot.balltown.cma.com\n``Nothing good has ever been reported about the full rotation of\n  a race car about either its pitch or roll axis''  -- Carroll Smith\n</td><td>7</td><td>rec.autos</td></tr><tr><td>From: mcostell@oasys.dt.navy.mil (Malcolm G.

I've been\ndoing it my self over 200,000 miles, on my current toyota truck I've got\nover 150k. I've heard people talk about how doing this can damage a\ntransmission. My experiences suggest otherwise. What techniques do you use?\n\nOn some old pieces of junk I drove, the transmission was so\nworn that pumping the clutch was the only way to shift, except clutchless.\nTo date I've driven rabbits, datsuns, comets, fords & a chevy. Some where\nharder than others to shift but generally the higher the milage the smoother\nquicker & easier they where to shift.\n\nMy technique is to ease back off the throttle and at the same time gently\nwrist back on the shift lever. If for some reason I miss the shift window,\nI lightly press the accelerator & try agian. I've found that clutchless\nshifting is eaiser/quicker at high rpms (4000-7000). I also skip gears some\ntimes using 1-3-5 ,1-2-4-5. \n\nkrispy\n</td><td>7</td><td>rec.autos</td></tr><tr><td>From: hhm@cbnewsd.cb.att.com (herschel.h.mayo)\nSubject: Re: BRAINDEAD Drivers Who Don't Look Ahead--\nOrganization: Chicago Home for the Morally Challenged\nDistribution: usa\nKeywords: bad drivers\nLines: 27\n\n\n> I agree that if traffic is all blocked up and you want to pass, you might\n> not feel like moving over for someone behind you because you don't want to\n> give them that one car-length, when they should just wait like you are.\n> BUT, if you're one of those people that just sit's behind the person, and\n> doesn't flash them with the high beams, or pull left and flash them, or\n> ride their bumper, or otherwise tell them that you *do* in fact want to \n> go by, and you're not just drafting them, then get the hell out of the \n> way of someone who will!

In the early 80's with the\nfuel crisis, etc., everyone wanted better fuel mileage.  Diesel fuel\nwas the cheapest fuel available and usually provides better mileage\nthan comparable gasoline engines.  So, GM decided to conver their\n350 gas engine into a diesel engine (I think was a 5.7 liter).  Big\nmistake.  The engine was not redesigned, but converted.  The engine\ncould not handle the higher compression, etc.  Lots of problems with\nthese cars.  This thew up a big red flag to the casual observer --\nDON\"T BUY A DIESEL.  THEY ARE BAD.  This was a gross generalization.\n\nAsk yourself this question -- if your livelihood depended on driving,\nLOTS of it, would you use a dependable or undependable (but cheaper\nin the short run) vehicle?  What do Greyhound busses have in them?\nTrailer Trucks?  Even Train Locomotives?  Are these gasoline engines?\nNo, they are diesel.  Tractor trailer truck manufacturers provide a\n500,000 mile warrantee with they vehicles.\n\nI own an `82 Diesel Suburban.  The 6.2L diesel is a GREAT engine.\nJust keeps going.  It was more expensive (when new) than the gasoline\nengine vehicle was.  The only problem with diesel engines is that \nwhen they need to be rebuilt, they are expensive.  In a gas 350\nengine, you will pay about $1000 for a rebuild.  Diesel 6.2L is about\n$2000.  But then again, the diesel engine lasts about twice as long\nand gets about 50% better mileage.  A carburator for a gasoline engine\ncosts about $100 to rebuild (or less).  A rebuild of the fuel injection\npump on a diesel will cost about $500 (or more).  But then again,\nyou never need a tune-up.\n\nIf you're looking at a rebuilt 6.2L, I'd say you got a great deal.\nCheck to see if the fuel injection pump was rebuilt also.\n\nGood luck.\n</td><td>7</td><td>rec.autos</td></tr><tr><td>From: rhorwell@crab.atc.boeing.com (Roland Faragher-Horwell,crab)\nSubject: Re: What is \" Volvo \" ?\nReply-To: rhorwell@atc.boeing.com\nOrganization: Boeing Computer Services\nLines: 46\n\nIn article 21071@sernews.raleigh.ibm.com, mperry@vnet.ibm.com (Mark Perry) writes:\n>>Hardly a good reason, most US cars do too - and plenty of people\n>>buy them (in the US anyway :-).

(was Re: Too fast)\nOrganization: Purdue University\nDistribution: usa\nLines: 28\n\n Remember roads in America are NOT designed for speeds above 80 meaning they\nwould be safe at 55-65. Roads like the Autobahn are smoother, straiter,\nwider and slightly banked. \n\nExample: A few months back I was traveling late at  night ( 3:00 am or so)\nand I was changing highways at a bent crosssing. It  curved off to the south\neast becoming hidden by trees after about 1,000 ft and continued to the\nleft strait north. I wanted to turn north, checked the south lane, rolled\ninto the crossing and checked the north lane. Nevertheless there wasn't \na car in sight, so I took one last look and pulled into the left hand lane.\nNow my car isn't a 5 sec 0-60 performer but I was in the corect lane and \nover 40 in decent time, even at 3:00 I wasn't wasting time. It was then\nthat I checked my mirror and saw a Mustang closing in my lane *FAST*, he \nhad just turned the corner and was just noticing me. Luckly he saw me and \nchanged lanes in time, I estamate he was moving in excess of 90 or so.\nI was just a by stander, I had no chance of runing from him, or moving out \nof his way. I'm glad he saw my brake lights in time. I shudder to \nthink of what would have happened had I wainted to pull out and not \nleft the time he needed to dodge me.\n\nRule: Just because your car can do 100+, and  your way is clear,\ndon't assume it will stay that way.\n\n      ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n      TRAVIS disclamer: the ideas expressed above are in fact the same as \n                        my employer, since I have none |-)\n           e-mail, flame, at : marshatt@feserve.cc.purdue.edu\n      ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n</td><td>7</td><td>rec.autos</td></tr><tr><td>From: mps1@cec1.wustl.edu (Mihir Pramod Shah)\nSubject: Re: new saturn argument\nArticle-I.D.: wuecl.1993Apr6.225025.13054\nOrganization: Washington University, St. Louis MO\nLines: 78\nNntp-Posting-Host: cec1\n\nIn article <C50p1M.21o@noose.ecn.purdue.edu> rjwade@rainbow.ecn.purdue.edu (Robert J.

Most of the other\nmodels are in the same class, but aren't the first cars you would think of.\nI threw in the Escort/Tracer because it has a good amount of Japanese\ntechnology and has similar reliability stats.  I didn't include domestic small\ncars such as the Cavalier, Sunbird, Shadow, Sundance, Tempo, and Topaz, since I\nthink Saturn is going after cars that have at least some degree of Japanese\nroots.\n\nThe SC1/SC2 was meant to compete against the following cars:\n\nToyota Paseo\nHonda Civic Si/Civic Coupes/del Sol Si\nNissan NX1600/NX2000\nMazda MX-3\nIsuzu Impulse\nGeo Storm\nFord Escort GT\n\n\nIf you look at the prices of these cars, they're more expensive than they're\n4-door counterparts.  The is good reason for this.  It is a more upscale and\ntrend-driven market.  Even though many of these models are based on sedan\nplatforms, their interior, etc. is good enough to warrant slightly higher\nprices.  Here are some of the platform derivations I can think of:\n\nTercel -> Paseo\nSentra -> NX1600/NX2000\nCivic -> del Sol\n323 -> MX-3 (not sure on this one)\nStylus -> Impulse/Storm\n\nTo illustrate, a Tercel starts at around $8000, while the Paseo starts at\naround $11,000.  Even a 4-door Tercel will cost less than a 2-door Paseo.  Now,\nyou might be saying that the Tercel doesn't offer the power that some 4-doors\noffer.  What I mean is that there is no 4-dr Tercel with a comparable\npowerplant as its sport coupe derivative.  Let's take another example: the\nIsuzu Stylus XS and Impulse XS/Storm GSi.  Both have the same powerplants (a\n1.6L 140hp engine), but the smaller 2-dr coupes are generally more expensive.\nAgain, this is because the two-door sport coupe market is a more\nfashion-oriented and trend-setting segment.  People are willing to pay more\nmoney for this type of car.  \n\n\nIn short, even though the SC1/SC2 may be smaller, hence \"less\" car, it's market\norientation dictates a slightly higher price than its mechanically equivalent\nsedan (SL1/SL2) version.\n\nI hope this clears things up a bit......\n\n\nMihir Shah\n\t \n</td><td>7</td><td>rec.autos</td></tr><tr><td>From: aep@world.std.com (Andrew E Page)\nSubject: Re: Importing Volvo?\nOrganization: The World Public Access UNIX, Brookline, MA\nLines: 9\n\n\n   There was an article in Business week not more the 4 weeks ago\non this very subject.

This article\nwill provide the essential information for doing so on standard\nUnix systems.  A shell script and examples of alias file setups\nare included which presently run on a Sparc 2 here at balltown.cma.com\nfor a number of mailing lists.  Note that if you do set up an automotive\nmailing list, please let me know of the -request address so that I can\nlist it in the montly rec.autos posting.  Also inform the keeper of the\nUsenet list-of-lists (check news.answers for this monthly posting.)\n\nFirst of all, to get anywhere, you need to either 1) be a sysadmin,\nor 2) have some measure of assistance from your sysadmin.  It is also\nimportant that you have reasonably good network connectivity; if it seems\nlike you get everything several days after anyone else, or that you\nhave trouble getting email through, then your network connectivity is\nprobably not good enough.\n\nListserv:\n\nThere is a handy automated mailing list package named listserv, which\nis available from several ftp servers on the network.  Details of\nthe installation and operation of listserv are beyond the scope of this\narticle, but anyone who is considering running a large mailing list should\nprobably  look at listserv carefully.\n\nThe Alias file:\n\nOn a typical unix system; there is a file named /usr/lib/aliases on\nwhichever file server is your mail host; it contains lines such as:\n\nfoo:   bar, baz, bletch\n\n\nwhich means that any email sent the name `foo' on that host is\nredistributed to users bar, baz, and bletch.  thus, the simplest\npossible email list is \n\nmy-favorite-car:  member1, member2, member3, my-address\nmy-favorite-car-request: my-address\n\nthis has a couple of problems; the most noticeable one being that\nyou have to be superuser to edit the alias file.  however, you can\ndo the following, with the connivance of your sysadmin:\n\nmy-favorite-car: :include:/home/mydir/misc/autos/my-favorite-car-list\nmy-favorite-car-request: my-address\n\nWhere the file specified is a list of comma and newline separated\naddresses.  This file can be in the list admin's home directory,\nowned by the list admin.\n\nBounced Mail:\n\nthis still has a problem; bounced mail usually gets distributed to all the\nmembers of the list, which is generally considered somewhat irritating.\nTherefore, the way that the driving school mailing list is set up\nis instructive (Thanks to harpal chohan of the bmw list for this setup,\nby the way.  I'm not sure where he got it from.)\n\n\nschool-request:   welty\nschool-rebroadcast:  :include:/home/newwelty/misc/autos/school/list\nschool: \"|/usr/local/adm/bin/explscript school\"\nowner-school: school-request\nowner-school-out: school-request\n\n\nhere's what is going on here:\n\nthe owner- and -request addresses are intended as traps for bounced mail\ncoming from the network.  the -request address also serves as the point\nof contact for administrative duties.\n\nschool is what people send mail to; instead of pointing at addresses,\nit points at a shell script which rewrites headers before resending\nthe email.  school-broadcast (of which nobody except me knows the name;\nthe name has been changed here to protect my own sanity) points at the\nactual list members.\n\nthe shell script i use is as follows:\n\n-----------------\n#!/bin/sh\ncd /tmp\nsed -e '/^Reply-To:/d' -e '/^Sender:/d' -e '/^From /d' | \\\n        (echo Reply-To: ${1}@balltown.cma.com; \\\n         echo Errors-To: ${1}-request@balltown.cma.com; \\\n         echo Sender: ${1}-request@balltown.cma.com; \\\n         cat -) | \\\n        /usr/lib/sendmail -om -f ${1}-request@balltown.cma.com \\\n                -F \"The ${1} Mailing List\" ${1}-rebroadcast\nexit 0\n-------------------\n\nnote that this script does not know the name of the list; the name\nis passed in from outside, so that the script may be used for multiple\nlists (i run several out of this site.)\nthe script excises Reply-To:, Sender:, and From lines from the incoming\nmessage, substitutes for Sender: and Reply-To:, and adds Errors-to:\n99.9% of all email bounce messages end up being sent to the -request\nor owner- addresses if this header rewrite is done.\n\nFor digested lists, there is some digestification software around.\nHopefully I'll be able to provide more information in a future version\nof this posting.\n\nrichard welty (welty@balltown.cma.com)\n-- \nrichard welty        518-393-7228       welty@cabot.balltown.cma.com\n``Nothing good has ever been reported about the full rotation of\n  a race car about either its pitch or roll axis''  -- Carroll Smith\n</td><td>7</td><td>rec.autos</td></tr><tr><td>From: jimiii@nimbus.com (Jim Warford)\nSubject: Re: electronic odometers (was: Used BMW Question ..... ???)\nReply-To: jimiii@nimbus.com (Jim Warford)\nOrganization: Nimbus Technology, Santa Clara, CA USA\nLines: 32\n\nIn article <13269@news.duke.edu> klg@mookie.mc.duke.edu (Kim Greer) writes:\n>\n>  I was wondering if anyone can shed any light on just how it is that these\n>electronic odometers remember the total elapsed mileage?

I won the battle but \nlost the war.  The arbitrator found that the car was \ndefective, but decided to offer a repurchase well below \nmarket value :(.  At the time of the hearing, average \nretail on my truck in the NADA book was $21,025, but \nthe decision was for  $17,665.  I wrote a letter to the \nCouncil of Better Business Bureaus pointing out the \nfact that if you have an automobile that does not \ndepreciate rapidly, the manufacturer has no incentive \nto deal with you.  There is no way that the \nmanufacturer can loose because they can turn around and \nsell the vehicle at a profit if the consumer is awarded \na repurchase.  The attitude of Chevrolet's \nrepresentative at the hearing tends to support this \npoint of view;  he was totally unprepared and did not \nseem to take the proceeding very seriously.\n\nI decided to take the repurchase, even though I am \ngetting totally screwed on the price.  I will not have \nto deal with continuing repairs or selling a lemon \nmyself, and I have no case for a civil suit based on \nthe Idaho lemon law.  I am planning to send a letter to \nmy elected representatives telling them how utterly \nridiculous the Idaho lemon law is.  The law allows for \na \"use deduction\" equal to the IRS mileage allowance.  \nAs if Chevrolet were buying my gas and paying \nfor my insurance.\n\nSummary of the case:  In May 1992 I bought a new 3/4 ton\nHD Chevrolet pickup.  Between May 1992 and December 1992 \nthis vehicle required repair after repair.  Systems \nthat required attention included the transmission, \nheater fan, paint, suspension, and motor.  The main \nproblem was the five speed manual transmission.  They \ncould not install a non-defective transmission in at \nleast four attempts.\n\nSo, in summary, it is possible to get a repurchase, but \nyou are going to get screwed on the price, unless you \npaid too much in the first place, or if your car \nhappens to be a model that depreciates rapidly.\n\njackw@hpdmd48.boi.hp.com\n\n</td><td>7</td><td>rec.autos</td></tr><tr><td>Subject: Re: Ford SHO engine parts!\nFrom: david.bonds@cutting.hou.tx.us (David Bonds) \nReply-To: david.bonds@cutting.hou.tx.us (David Bonds) \nDistribution: world\nOrganization: The Cutting Edge - Houston, TX - 713-466-1525\nLines: 21\n\n\nW >>will NOT do work on internal engine components of the SHO engine.

The 60 is the `aspect ratio'; it indicates the height of the\n    sidewall of the tire relative to the overall width.  Our example tire\n    has a sidewall height of 0.60 * 195 ~= 117 mm.  The 14 is the wheel\n    diameter in inches; there are also some special tires called `TRX'\n    tires which have three digit metric wheel diameter designations, like\n    390, which is in millimeters.  The R means Radial, and the H is a speed\n    rating indicating the highest speed at which the tire, when properly\n    inflated and carrying an appropriate load, may safely operate.  Common\n    speed ratings are S (112MPH), T (118MPH), H (130MPH), and V (up to\n    150MPH.)\n\n    Recent changes to the method for specifying tire sizes move the speed\n    rating to a different part of the designation; you may therefore find\n    designations like 195/60R14 85H; the 85 indicates the per-tire load\n    associated with the speed rating -- exceeding this load in continuous\n    operation at the rated speed is dangerous practice.  What follows is\n    a table showing a number of `load indices' and corresponding maximum\n    per-tire loads:\n\n    Load Index       50   51   88   89   112   113   145   149   157\n    Max Load (Kg)   190  195  560  580  1120  1150  2900  3250  4125\n\n    Note that the usual mass vs. weight confusion occurs in this table.\n\n    In some cases, the letters P or LT may be found in front of a tire\n    size; the LT designation indicates Light Truck, and the P designation\n    indicates Passenger car.  If no letter is given, then the application\n    of the tire is Passenger car usage.  As far as I know, these letters\n    only appear in the US market.  The LT designation is prinicipally of\n    interest to owners of light trucks and other utility vehicles.  For\n    the owner of a passenger vehicle, there is no meaningful difference\n    between a tire with a P designation and one with no designation at\n    all.\n\n    If the aspect ratio is omitted, it is probably 80, but may be 78.\n\n    Tires with an MS (mud/snow) designation may have their speed rating\n    reduced by 20 km/h (about 12mph.)\n\n    There is an additional set of ratings on tires for temperature,\n    traction, and treadwear.  Temperature and Traction are graded\n    A, B, and C (with A the best and C the worst); treadwear is\n    a numeric rating.  These values are of limited value, as they\n    are assigned somewhat arbitrarily by tire manufacturers and are\n    thus not useful in comparing different brands of tires.\n\nQ:  My car has tires with a funny size designation:  185/65HR390; can i put\n    normal tires on the car?\n\nA:  Your tires are called TRX tires; they were devised by Michelin.\n    Because of a somewhat different bead design, they are incompatible\n    with normal tires; Michelin used a different diameter wheel for them\n    so that they could not be mounted on the wrong type wheel (and so that\n    more conventional tires could not be mounted on TRX type wheels.)\n    You will need to aquire different wheels to put a normal tire on your\n    car; it is barely possible to fit normal tires on TRX wheels, and horribly\n    dangerous to do so (the tires may simply peel off the rims in a corner,\n    or possibly blow out at high speed.)  TRX type tires are becoming hard\n    to find; in addition to Michelin, Avon makes suitable tires.  Goodyear\n    has apparently discontinued their line of TRX tires.\n\nQ:  Can I rotate radials from side to side, or rotate them only on one side\n    of my car?\n\nA:  Car and tire manufacturers have differing views on this subject; many\n    say that swapping radials between the left and right hand sides of a\n    car is now ok (this group includes Michelin and Goodyear); others\n    (for example, Pirelli and Nokia) will void warranties if such swapping\n    is done.  The best advice is to read your tire manual carefully before\n    rotating your tires, and stick to the manufacturer's recommendations.\n\nQ:  How many snow tires should I buy, and if I buy 2, which end of the\n    car should I put them on?\n\nA:  In short, 4, and both ends.  To explain, many drivers in areas that don't\n    get excessive snow or who don't drive agressively (or at all) in snow\n    conditions get away with only two snows on the drive wheels, but there\n    are circumstances where this can be dangerous practice.  With a rear\n    wheel drive car, you can choose between being able to start the car\n    going (a function of the rear axle) or stopping and turning the car\n    (a function of the front axle.)  In a front wheel drive car, you start,\n    stop, and turn with the front end.  The primary risk of putting the\n    snow tires on the front only is that if you have to put on the brakes\n    while going downhill, you run a serious risk of going downhill backwards.\n\nRadar Detectors and Speed Limits:\n\nQ:  Why aren't there any comments on Radar Detectors and Speed Limits\n    in this Q&A posting?\n\nA:  Because questions about detectors and speed limits crossposted between\n    misc.consumers and rec.autos.* always start long, tedious, and pointless\n    flame wars.  If you want to talk about either of these topics, please\n    subscribe to rec.autos or alt.flame and keep it there.\n\nSafety Equipment:\n\nQ:  Do airbags really work?\n\nA:  Preliminary statistics suggest the following:  Airbags work much\n    better than no belts; good 3 point belts alone work much better than\n    Airbags alone, and AirBags + 3 point belts work slightly better than\n    3 point belts alone.  The con to airbags is that some designs tend\n    to burn the driver's hands when venting the byproducts of the\n    explosion that occurs inside the bag, and that some designs (but\n    not all) may knock the driver's hands from the wheel, making retention\n    of control of the vehicle after the bag deflates more difficult.\n\nBrake Questions:\n\nQ:  Do I always need to get the rotors on my disk brakes turned?  Midas\n    always wants to do this.\n\nA:  No.  There are specific conditions that mandate turning or replacing\n    rotors; some shops try and make a little extra money by replacing rotors\n    more often than is strictly necessary.  if the rotors are not warped\n    warped, and only lightly grooved, then there is no need to replace or\n    to turn them.  Note also that some rotors (the rotors on many Hondas\n    are a good example) are so narrow to begin with that it is not practical\n    to turn them; they must be replaced when they become too thin, warped,\n    or badly grooved.\n\nQ:  They tell me I should downshift when braking to slow my car down.  Is\n    this really a good idea?\n\nA:  It used to be a very good idea, back in the days of mediocre, fade\n    prone drum brakes.  In modern disc brake equipped cars, use of\n    downshifting to slow the car is not really necessary, except in cases\n    of long, steep downhill runs.  Otherwise, modern disc brakes are more\n    than adequate to stop a passenger car in all circumstances, and they\n    are much cheaper to repair than clutch linings.\n\n    On the other hand, many standard driver's license tests in the USA\n    still specify that the driver being tested downshift under braking; I\n    suggest that before taking a US driver's test, you either 1) learn to\n    do this smoothly (which takes some time and practice) or 2) borrow a\n    car with an automatic to take the test.\n\nQ:  How often should I replace my brake fluid?\n\nA:  Probably more often than you do.  Traditional brake fluids tend to\n    absorb water; this water can corrode internal parts of the brake\n    system and also lower the boiling point of the fluid.  DOT-3 type\n    are older fluids; DOT-4 and DOT-5 are newer specifications.  The\n    principal differences are in wet and dry boiling points; the dry\n    boiling point is important in fresh brake fluid, but the wet boiling\n    point is important in older brake fluid.  DOT-3 fluids have the lowest\n    wet and dry boiling point _requirements_; DOT-4 fluids have better\n    boiling point requirements; and DOT-5 fluids have the best boiling\n    point requirements (but DOT-5 fluids are not clearly superior; see\n    the next Q&A for more details.)  While the requirements imply that\n    DOT-4 fluids are better than DOT-3 fluids, there may be specific\n    cases where a DOT-3 fluid is preferable, but these are mostly\n    competition applications.  Otherwise, DOT-4 type fluids offer _much_\n    improved brake pedal feel.  Replacement once a year is recommended for\n    DOT-4 fluids, although agressive drivers may profit by changing out\n    fluid more frequently, or at least bleeding a modest amount of fluid\n    out of the brake calipers fairly regularly.\n\nQ:  What about DOT-5 brake fluids?\n\nA:  This breaks down in to two parts.  The DOT-5 specification looks\n    excellent for performance, but the first DOT-5 fluids were Silicone\n    based.  Silicone fluids are a tricky proposition.  Unlike DOT-3 and\n    DOT-4 fluids, they do not absorb water at all.  While this may sound\n    like a feature, the problem is that any water present pools up in\n    such systems, interfering with braking performance and corroding any\n    metals at the spot where the pooling is occuring.  The water will tend\n    to migrate downwards in the braking system to the brake calipers, where\n    most of the corrosion occurs.\n\n    Because of this phenomenon, it is essential when converting to\n    Silicone to empty the entire brake system and flush it throughly\n    beforehand; some even recommend replacing all rubber parts in the\n    brake system when converting to Silicone fluids.\n\n    Two other issues that come up with silicone fluids:  1) they are\n    difficult to pour cleanly (that is, without air bubbles), which\n    interferes with getting a good brake pedal feel, and 2) while they\n    generally have much higher boiling points than DOT-4 fluids, they\n    do have high temperature failure modes which are indistinguishable\n    in effect from boiling DOT-4 fluids.  SIlicone fluids may make sense\n    in some street car applications, but they are certainly not\n    recommended for high performance driving applications, and the\n    economics are questionable for street use.\n\n    I have recently become aware of new fluids that meet the DOT-5 standard\n    that do not contain Silicones; these fluids appear to be reasonably\n    compatible with the older DOT-3 and DOT-4 fluids, but I have little\n    information at this time.\n\nQ:  ABS is available on some of the cars I'm looking at, but it costs\n    more.  Is it worth it?\n\nA:  This does not have a cut and dried answer; therefore, this answer will\n    be quite long in order to cover the pros and cons.  The short answer\n    is that ABS costs more, both initially, and to maintain, will generally\n    work better for the `average driver' (that is to say, a driver who does\n    not have extensive experience in high performance driving techniques),\n    and may require the `unlearning' of some obsolete braking techniques\n    like pump braking which should be unlearned in any case.\n\n    Now for the long answer.  ABS works by monitering the wheels of the\n    car, looking for signs of locked brakes.  It may or may not be able\n    be able to distinguish between the different wheels (there are several\n    systems on the market.)  It cannot detect impending lockup (which is\n    what you would really want in an ideal world), but only the existence\n    of lockup.  The sensors used vary; some of the less well designed\n    sensors are sensitive to tire size, and to brake pad material, and\n    may cease to function properly if the owner deviates from original\n    equipment or OE-equivalent components.\n\n    When the sensors detect lockup, the ABS system responds by unlocking\n    the brakes (either individually, or all at once, depending on the\n    system.)  If the driver keeps their foot firmly planted, the ABS\n    will end up cycling between the locked and unlocked states (if a\n    sensor existed that could detect _impending lockup_, then we could\n    sit right at that point, which is where maximum braking effect is\n    achieved.)  This pulsing can often be felt in the brake pedal, as\n    the system cycles.  The percentage of the time that the brakes are\n    truly engaged is called the `duty cycle'; typically in an ABS system\n    this is about 40%  On dry pavement, a trained driver can beat this\n    duty cycle quite reliably using a technique called threshold braking;\n    on wet pavement, braking is so chancy that ABS will outperform\n    threshold braking nearly every time.  Unfortunately, on mud and on\n    snow, often maximum braking effect can be acheived with the brakes\n    locked; only Audi, of the manufacturers producing ABS-equipped cars,\n    has seen fit to provide a disable switch for the ABS system for this\n    eventuality.\n\n    A particularly important feature of ABS is that it preserves\n    steering control.  This is the case simply because, if you are\n    braking near the limit and turn the wheel, the ABS will release\n    the brakes if it sees steering-triggered lockup, and back off\n    on the percentage of the time that the brakes are applied.\n    Braking distances will lengthen accordingly.\n\n    An important caution:  ABS cannot exceed the maximum theoretical\n    braking force in any given situation; if you start sliding on\n    glare ice, don't expect an ABS system to help you out very much.\n    The coefficient of friction is not changed by the presence of an\n    ABS system in your car.\n\n    As far as maintenence goes, in addition to the potential\n    restrictions I've listed above, you have to worry about the\n    following:  1) parts costs are much higher; the OE master cylinder\n    for my obscure european sedan lists for $185, but the OE master\n    cylinder for the ABS-equipped version of the same car lists for\n    over $1000.  Most manufacturers explicitly forbid use of DOT-5\n    (silicone) brake fluids in ABS-equipped vehicles.  Because of\n    the potential cost of replacement of corroded brake system\n    components, regular (I suggest annual) replacement of brake fluid\n    becomes very important.\n\nQ:  What about this threshold braking business?\n\nA:  [normally, I'd not put this in the consumers Q&A, but recent\n    publicity about a number of accidents involving police drivers\n    in ABS-equipped Chevy Caprices suggests that this section is\n    needed here -- rpw]\n\n    Threshold braking is a technique practiced by all serious high\n    performance drivers; if made a habit, it replaces the `stab\n    the pedal and lock 'em up' panic habit entirely, and is much\n    to be prefered.  Basically, the premise is that tires generate\n    maximum braking force when they have just started to slide, but\n    just before the wheels lock up entirely.  Drivers who threshold\n    brake learn to feel what this `threshold' feels like, and learn\n    to search for it and hit it on the application of the brake\n    pedal.  In many cars, you can feel that you are near the\n    threshold when the pedal starts to firm up as you depress it.\n    In any case, if you can't hear the tires whine just a bit, you're\n    not very near the threshold.\n\n    In a car with ABS, often there is a twinge in the pedal just\n    before the system starts cycling; if the driver backs off on\n    the pedal just a tad when the twinge is felt, then they are very\n    close to the threshold and they'll probably achieve better\n    stopping distances than if they just punched it and let the ABS\n    take over.\n\n    Recently, there has been a rash of publicity over a number of\n    accidents, and one death, involving police cars equipped with\n    ABS systems.  The police departments in question quickly blamed\n    the new ABS systems, but according to Autoweek magazine, it now\n    seems clear that the problem was a lack of training; none of the\n    involved officers had any recent performance driving training.\n    There is reason to believe that the drivers reacted to the pulsing\n    brake pedal by `pump braking', an old and discredited technique\n    of stabbing and releasing the brake pedal, the goal being to\n    try and get brakes back with a failing hydraulic system.  If you\n    think about it for a minute, you'll realize that pump braking must\n    cut the effective operation of a working brake system by at least\n    1/2, so if you cut the 40% duty cycle of an ABS system by that\n    much, you are giving up most of your brakes for the wrong reason.\n    Threshold braking has the advantage in that it is an effective\n    and useful technique regardless of whether your car has ABS; if\n    you do fear a failed hydraulic system, then one or two stabs at\n    the pedal will be sufficient.    \n\nGas Questions:\n\nQ:  Does High Octane gasoline help?\n\nA:  Maybe, maybe not.  Some cars have knock sensors, and can adjust the\n    engine timing or turbocharger boost to suit the gasoline being used.\n    On most cars, however, you should use the cheapest gas that makes your\n    car run well.  Check your owner's manual for details on what your car\n    needs.\n\nQ:  My car was made for leaded gasoline.  Will unleaded gas hurt it?\n\nA:  It is possible that unleaded gas may *slightly* increase valve wear,\n    although the Amoco Oil company argues otherwise.  The actual increase\n    in valve wear will be almost unnoticeable, however, as modern leaded\n    gasolines actually contain very little lead.  You should, however,\n    check your owner's manual; many cars from the early 1970s do not\n    actually require leaded gasoline.\n\nQ:  Do fuel treatments help?  What kind should I use?\n\nA:  Some do and some don't.  During the winter, it is a good idea to use\n    dry gas; however, some may be harmful to fuel injection systems.\n    Never use an additive containing Methanol (sometimes called Methyl\n    Alcohol); such additives may damage fuel systems in cars with carbs\n    and almost certainly will damage cars with fuel injection.\n\n    Manufacturer's opinions vary on additives containing Ethanol (sometimes\n    called Ethyl Alcohol); if your car has fuel injection, check the owner's\n    manual on your car before  using these.  Most manufacturers consider\n    10% Ethanol acceptable in gasoline.  Additives with Isopropyl Alcohol\n    (Isopropanol), and Petroleum  Distillates are fine in fuel injected\n    cars.\n\n    An occasional bottle of fuel injector cleaner is helpful in cars with\n    fuel injectors, although many premium gasolines contain detergents that\n    do the same job.  Some off brands of fuel injector cleaners contain\n    Ethanol or Methanol; always check the ingredients before putting anything\n    in your gas tank.\n\n    There are a small number of particularly good additives; these are\n    noticeably more expensive that the run-of-the-mill ones, but work\n    much, much better.  Among these are Chevron Techron, Redline SL-1,\n    Wurth `Lubrimoly Ventil Sauber', and BG 44K.  A bottle of one of these,\n    once every six months, is highly recommended.\n\nQ:  What about detergent gasolines?\n\nA:  The quality of detergent packages in gasolines varies somewhat; BMW\n    has instituted a testing program, and gasoline brands which pass this\n    test may advertise that fact.  Stickers indicating passage of the test\n    are now beginning to appear on fuel pumps at gas stations.  If such\n    gasolines are used, then fuel injector cleaners are probably optional.\n    Beforewarned that while use of BMW approved gasolines will keep a clean\n    engine clean, they may not clean a motor with bad valve deposits.\n\nLubrication Questions:\n\nQ:  What do the numbers and letters in a motor oil designation mean?\n\nA:  There are several different items encoded.  There is a two-letter\n    code indicating the type of detergent package that the manufacturer\t\n    uses in the oil; this looks like SE,SF,CD or such.  The S codes are\n    for gasoline engine applications; the C codes are for diesel engine\n    applications.  The second letter is assigned in sequence as new levels\n    of protection are developed; thus SF is considered better than SE,\n    SE is considered better than SD, and so forth.\n\n    The more noticeable designation is the oil weight.  This is either\n    a single number (e.g., 30 weight) or a pair of numbers separated by\n    the letter W (e.g., 10W30.)  The latter type is much more commonly\n    used these days, and are the only type that most automobile\n    manufacturers specify in operators manuals.  The first number in the\n    designation (10W) is the apparent viscosity of the oil when it is cold;\n    the W stands for `winter'.  The second number (30) is the viscosity\n    of the oil when hot.  There is a trick here; the oil doesn't actually\n    get thicker (turn from 10 weight to 30 weight) as it gets hotter.  What\n    is actually happening is that when the oil is cold, it has the viscosity\n    of a cold 10 weight oil.  as it gets hotter, it doesn't get thin as fast\n    as a 10W oil would; by the time it is up to temperature, it has the\n    viscosity of a hot 30 weight oil.\n\n    Note that these numbers actually specify ranges of viscosities; not\n    all 10W oils have exactly the same viscosity when cold, and not all\n    30 weight oils have the same viscosity when hot.  Note also that the\n    novel behaviour of multi-grade oils is caused by additives, and it has\n    been reported that with the sole exception of Castrol GTX, 10W40 oils\n    do not retain their multi-grade characteristics well over time.  10W30,\n    15W40, and 20W50 oils work very well, though.\n\nQ:  Are `quick lube' places any good?\n\nA:  Some do adequate work, but there are quite a few incompetent ones out\n    there.  Let the buyer beware, watch them while they work, make sure\n    that they don't overtorque the oil drain plug, and keep your hand on\n    your wallet at all times.\n\nQ:  Are oil additives like Slick-50 or Tufoil any good?\n\nA:  Slick-50 and Tufoil are PTFE-based additives.  Many of these have\n    come onto the market recently; they are different from the moly-based\n    additives that have been around since the early 50's.  PTFE is the\n    chemical name for Teflon(TM), a trademark owned by DuPont. In general,\n    auto manufacturers do not recommend use of these products.  Most USENET\n    responses to questions on these additives are favorable (slight\n    increase of MPG after application, smoother revving) but long term\n    results (whether PTFE additives are effective after 5K miles) are\n    debatable.  Some manufacturers (such as Saab) claim that either the\n    product or the engine flush that preceeds application causes\n    deterioration of the oil seals and eventual leakage.  Some BMW owners\n    have reported death of valve seals shortly after the addition of\n    Slick 50 to their cars.  This writer has been cautioned by a Slick-50\n    Dealer (!) that Slick-50 should _not_ be used in Japanese motors, as\n    it may clog the oil return passages in the engine.  Otherwise, there are\n    no known reports of damage caused by PTFE additives.\n\n    On the other hand, there are satified Slick 50 customers in the world.\n\nQ:  Do synthetic oils really work?\n\nA:  Yes, but.  More specifically, most auto manufactuers accept synthetics,\n    but disagree with the extremely long oil change intervals claimed by\n    oil manufacturers.  Auto manufacturers recommend that you continue to\n    change oil at the intervals recommended in the owners manual for your\n    car.  Even if you decide to try the longer intervals, at least change\n    the oil filter at regular intervals, as synthetics get just as dirty\n    as conventional oils.\n\n    Synthetic gear lubricants for manual transmissions are another matter\n    entirely; Amsoil, Redline, and AGIP are very highly regarded and very\n    effective.  Mobil 1 synthetic gear lube gets mixed reviews, however.\n\nQ:  Manufacturers are specifying longer and longer oil change intervals.\n    How often should I change my oil?\n\nA:  It depends on how you drive.  If your car always (or nearly always)\n    gets warmed up, and you don't drive it very hard and keep the revs\n    down, the manufacturer's recommendation is probably fine.  If, however,\n    you drive it hard, drive it at high revs, or alternatively, if you\n    only drive it to and from the supermarket so that it doesn't get up\n    to temperature, then you may wish to change oil much more often,\n    perhaps at 3000 mile intervals (given that most manufacturers are\n    now specifying 7500 mile intervals.)  If you don't drive your car\n    much at all (say 7500 miles a year), then you probably want to change\n    oil every six months anyway.  If you are storing a car during the winter,\n    then change oil before storing it and change oil when you bring it out\n    of storage.\n\nMisc. Questions:\n\nQ:  My car has a timing belt.  I hear that bad things happen when they\n    break.  What's the story?\n\nA:  It depends on the internal design of the motor.  Early Ford Escorts,\n    for example, will suffer severe valve damage if the belt breaks, but\n    the newer cars will just require a tow and installation of a new belt.\n    Some Honda motors will not be damaged, but others will be.\n\n    If no replacement interval is specified for your car, then change the\n    belt at least every 60,000 miles; some cars may require more frequent\n    replacement.  Ask your dealer or independent mechanic.  Also, ask if\n    there are any related repairs that should take place at the same time\n    (for example, the same Ford Escorts that suffer valve damage also have\n    a timing belt driven water pump, which has been known to seize,\n    destroying the timing belt, and which then causes major valve damage\n    as a side effect.  Replacing the timing belt while ignoring the water\n    pump can be a costly mistake.)\n\nQ:  Why would anyone be stupid enough to design a motor so that it\n    self destructs when the timing belt breaks?\n\nA:  For performance reasons.  Compromising piston design so that the\n    valves and pistons will not collide requires that the compression\n    ratio of the engine be reduced significantly; this is why you are\n    more likely to avoid valve damage in economy cars than in performance\n    oriented vehicles.\n\nQ:  What causes Unintended Acceleration?\n\nA:  The final report of the National Highway, Transportation, and Safety\n    Administration concluded that unintended acceleration could not be\n    caused by any mechanical failure of the vehicle in question and at the\n    same time be consistent with the physical evidence.  The NHTSA report\n    goes on to conclude that `pedal misapplication' by the vehicle operator\n    is probably the cause.\n-- \nrichard welty        518-393-7228       welty@cabot.balltown.cma.com\n``Nothing good has ever been reported about the full rotation of\n  a race car about either its pitch or roll axis''  -- Carroll Smith\n</td><td>7</td><td>rec.autos</td></tr><tr><td>From: pp29616@dcl-nextsc.cso.uiuc.edu (Paul Park)\nSubject: Re: Integra GSR (really about other cars)\nArticle-I.D.: news.C51Fs3.37C\nOrganization: University of Illinois at Urbana\nLines: 21\n\nIn article <1993Apr5.212645.15988@nntpd.lkg.dec.com>  \nkenyon@xqzmoi.enet.dec.com (Doug Kenyon (Stardog Champion)) writes:\n> \n> It's great that all these other cars can out-handle, out-corner, and  \nout-\n> accelerate an Integra.\n> \n> But, you've got to ask yourself one question: do all these other cars  \nhave\n> a moonroof with a sliding sunshade?

Drivers are much better disciplined in Europe than they are here.\n\nOh yeah, that would be paradise... in fact, you can forget it. From all I've\nheard from my U.S. relatives, drivers esp. here in Germany are much more agg-\nressive, but not disciplined. One of my relatives, a L.A. resident, hired a car\nat the Nuernberg airport and went about 18 miles to our home. He said then that\nhe grew about 1 year older during this ride and swore he'd never drive a car in\nGermany again (this was in 1982 and he kept his promise - the situation now is\neven worse as effect of the increased volume of traffic).\nWhat you mean by `better disciplined' should perhaps be considered `cautious due\nto fear': \nWhen driving around here, you always *have* to take into consideration that the\nmajority of the other drivers absolutely relies on you: They expect that nobody\nfails or sleeps; many of them exploit this by driving as fast as their car can\ngo (of course only where that is allowed, you might think - dream on :).\nSo any mistake you make is a very high risk to your health - and if you're ex-\nposed to such a situation from your very first day as a driver, you learn to\nhandle it - or you lose... \nThat's the way I and most people I know experience our traffic situation - \nwhether you think this is pleasant or efficient is up to you; I think we handle\na very high volume of traffic and that at high speeds with modest (compared to\nthe volume) and decreasing rates of lethal accidents - OTOH, more and more\npeople (esp. women) dislike driving (because they feel overtaxed and threatened)\nand each accident is one accident too much.\n\n>2. The roads comprising the Autobahn are much better designed than\n>   they are here, and usually include animal fences.  This makes them\n>   far more predictable than most US highways.\n\nBetter designed and maintained, may be - but animal fences are very rare. Auto-\nbahnen and many other streets have guard-rails (I hope that's the right word - \na plank made from thick steel sheet fixed on uprights; it's about 2 feet high);\nthose guard-rails are designed for keeping vehicles on the road.

When that light goes on, I just\ntake it to the delaer tell them \"It's that time\" and they work on it for 4 hou\nand you pay $5 for parts and $100 for labor. (Ahh...what they get for labor)\nI currently have about 95K on my Sprint and of all the times I took it in for\nservice, I never say on the payment sheet anything about the replacement of the\nOxygen sensor.  What the heck is an Oxygen sensor?  As far an I know of, I have\nnever had that thing replaced in my car and the car is purring like a kitten.\nNow, I don't have a/c (Mother Nature does that for me :-) ) and that might have\nsomething to do with it, but I still never heard of an Oxygen sensor.  The only\nMAJOR service job I have had on my car (besides getting the tires replaced\nif you want to call that a service job) was getting the Rotor, Distributor and\nGasket replaced.  And that was all done within the past 2 months.  \n\nWhat I do at 30K is have a good tune-up, let them replace what ever they need\nto, pay the bill (about $125) and go home and don't worry about the car for\nanother 30K.  Oh, I just remembered something.  If that little sensor light\nbothers you, in the fuse box right below the turn-signal lever up against\nthe dash, there is a swith on the right side.  Flip that switch and the light\nwill go off.  I do that so that little light won't annoy me.  If you can't\nfind it, look it up in the car manuel.  I hope that I have helped a little\nand good luck with the _Oxygen sensor_?\n\n\t\t\t\t- Thomas -\n\n******************************************************************************\n*  E-Mail Address: \t\t  *  \"Give me an an army of West Point,      *\n*\tTJZ6624@ZEUS.TAMU.EDU\t  *   graduates and I'll win a battle...     *\n*\t\t\t\t  *   Give me a handful of Texas Aggies,     *\n*  \"Creator of MOT POWER!\"\t  *   and I'll win a war.\"                   *\n*\t\t\t\t  *\t  - Gen.

There are actually many courteous drivers \non the road who do not intentionally impede others.  \n\nIf someone in front of me seems to be oblivious to the fact that they \nare blocking traffic I use my blinker or flash my lights, or, if all \nelse fails, will briefly speed up /slow down so they MIGHT get the \nmessage that I am a faster vehicle trying to pass.  I feel it is never \nsafe to ride anyone's bumper.  IF someone is intentionally blocking \ntraffic, because they feel that it is civil duty or philosophic duty \nor for some unfathomable reason, I feel they deserve, at the very least,\nderision.

There are two very long entry ramps which all the hurry-up\nyahoos dive into cause they want to get ahead. When we get to the point\nwhere these ramps merge, all hell breaks lose. The result is that traffic\nwhich was moving at 55 on the VA side of the bridge, stalls on t'other\nside. If these dingbats had stayed in lane, allowed the folks coming up\nthe two ramps to merge, we would still be doing 55. Instead we do start-\nstop for 4 miles.

Needless to say, they were not pleased by  \nthe turn of events.\n\nEarly the next morning I got a call from the general sales manager wanting  \nto know what happened. I related the story and he apologised profusely and  \nasked if there was anything they could do to change my mind. I told him  \nthat if they gave me the truck for free I probably still wouldn't take it,  \nthat there were other dealers in town, I was a repeat customer of theirs  \nand that they should learn how to treat customers,etc,etc...I was still  \npretty steamed about the whole affair. He gave me the line about hating to  \nlose a customer and they would try to find a solution, etc, etc. I told  \nhim not to bother, thanks, I'd go somewhere else.\n\nA couple hours later, the owner of the dealership called me, all  \napologetic, etc, etc, etc, and said that they would cover the $150 plus  \nknock another $400 off the price of the truck. I told him I'd think about  \nit and he gave me his private, direct phone number, his secretary's name,  \nand assured me that they valued me as a customer, etc etc etc....\n\nI thought about it for a few hours and discussed it with my wife and we  \ndecided, what the hell...that was a pretty decent deal, so I called him  \nback and accepted his offer. When I went back the next day to pick up the  \ntruck, I received the royal treatment. Everyone seemed to know about the  \nincident, even the lot boy. Everything went smoothly and I was out of  \nthere in my new truck in about 30 mins.\n\nSo, I guess I'm a reasonably satisfied customer. However, it should not  \nhave happened in the first place. I was a bit shocked to have a sales  \nperson talk to me like that. I don't expect them to bow and grovel, but I  \nsure don't expect to be given a hard time either, esp. when it's their  \nmistake.\n\nAnyway, I'm happy with the truck and it turned out to be a couple hundred  \ndollars under invoice and they paid most of the first year's license fee.  \nI'm not sure whether I'll go back to that dealer, tho.\n\nMark\n</td><td>7</td><td>rec.autos</td></tr><tr><td>From: markm@latium.

The older cars are \nappreciating... slowly.

The solid axle is theoretically stronger and\nmore reliable than the newer model, but only experience will tell. The\nindependant front suspension is, no doubt, a compromise made to satisfy\nthe typical user, who will never need a real utility vehicle. The second\ndifference is the type of transfer case used on the newer models. I'm\nnot sure, but I think Tioyota went to a full-time 4WD or all-wheel drive\nsystem. The older Landcruisers have a \"lock-up\" type. Both have their\nadvantages and disadvantages.\n\n\tPaul Hovnanian\thovnania@atc.boeing.com\n\t[Std disclaimers apply]\n</td><td>7</td><td>rec.autos</td></tr><tr><td>From: barryf@hpfcso.FC.HP.COM (Barry Fowler)\nSubject: Re: Impala SS going into production!\nOrganization: HP Colorado Computer Mfg.

When a friend of mine went shopping for a small\nsedan a few years ago, she brought me along as a token male so\nthe salespeople wouldn't give her the \"bimbo\" treatment.\nHer first choice was a Mazda 323, and second choice was a Nissan\nSentra.  We went to a Mazda dealership and described what \"we\"\nwanted.  We started negotiating on the price, and the salesdroid\nkept playing the \"let me run this price by the sales manager\".  After\nplaying the \"good salesman, bad salesman\" game, we finally told him\nthat if he didn't have the authority to negotiate a price, perhaps\nwe should be speaking directly to someone who did.  He brought in\nthe sales manager who proceeded to dick us around with every trick\nin the book.  (Read Remar Sutton's \"Don't Get Taken Every Time\" for a\nlist.)  Finally, after playing a few more rounds of \"you'll have to\nwork with us on this price\", also known as \"each time you come up a\nthousand dollars we'll come down ten\", the salesmanager gave a signal to\nhis two sales cronies, stood up, and said \"well, we can't come down any\nmore so I guess we can't help you\" and they trouped out of the room,\nleaving us sitting in the salesman's office all by ourselves.  Hmm.\nI'd read that sleazy salesmen sometimes bug their own offices so they\ncan leave and listen in on couples discussing the sales offer, and\nI mentioned this aloud to my friend while we were sitting there wondering\nwhy they would leave us in the office instead of showing us to the\ndoor.  For lack of anything better to do, I picked up the phone on\nthe desk and called another Mazda dealership, asked for a salesman,\nand began discussing what kind of price they would consider.  A few\nsentences into the conversation, Mr. Salesmanager broke into the line\n(!) and began telling me how rude he thought it was that I would call\nanother dealership from \"his\" phone!  I said that since he'd announced\nthat our business was over, he shouldn't care, and every time I tried\nto talk to the other sales guy the sales manager would drown out our\nvoices with his own.  (How did he know that I was using the phone,\nanyway?)  Finally, I hung up and we headed out of the showroom.\nSales manager and cronies come out of a little unmarked room and he\nbegins to berate us again.  We say that we won't bother him anymore,\nwe're going next door to the Nissan dealership.\n\nThen comes the part I wish I could have videotaped.  As we go out\nthe front door, the sales manager SHOUTS across the entire showroom,\ncustomers and all, \"Go ahead!  You DESERVE to buy a Nissan!\"\nSo my friend bought a Sentra.\n\nJust so the guilty won't go unpunished, I'll mention that the\nsales manager's name was Gary Tusone.  From his manner, his\nrefusal to come down to a reasonable price, and his anger at the\nend, my guess is that he had bet our original salesman (who was\na young novice) that he'd be able to get at least X dollars out of\nus, and he was steamed that we wouldn't fall for his slimy tricks.\n</td><td>7</td><td>rec.autos</td></tr><tr><td>From: ak296@yfn.ysu.edu (John R.

A family sedan designed to be\noperable at 85mph doesn't suddenly become operable at 130mph because\nyou added some plastic aero effects, slightly wider tires, and a much\nlarger engine.  That's what the SHO is -- a slightly modified family\nsedan with a powerful engine.  They didn't even bother improving the\n*brakes.*\n\nThe Mustang is essentially the same deal as the SHO -- a big power\nplant stuck in a mid-size sedan, with almost no other modifications.\nI have real-life experience with the Mustang -- it handles like a\nbrick (except when you're invoking oversteer, of course, something I\npersonally avoid doing on the highway) and stopping power is\ninadequate even from 80mph.  Lots of accelleration -- but the rest of\nthe car is not up to par.\n\nI picked the Porsche example because they are designed with speed in\nmind.  It didn't have to be the 911 -- it could have been the much\ncheaper 944 or one of several Mercedes or Audi models.  All of these\ncars are fairly expensive -- but so are the parts that make them\ndrivable at high speed.  This should be elementary.\n\nThere are a few things to keep in mind about Europe, since you brought\nit up.  My Autobahn knowledge is admittedly second-hand, but I believe\nthe following to be true:\n\n1. Drivers are much better disciplined in Europe than they are here.\n2. The roads comprising the Autobahn are much better designed than\n   they are here, and usually include animal fences.  This makes them\n   far more predictable than most US highways.\n3. Not all of Europe is the Autobahn.  Most places in Europe have\n   speed limits that aren't out-of-line with what we used to have in\n   the US -- if my friends weren't lying to me they're typically not\n   much higher than 120km/h.\n\nI strongly suspect you won't find a lot of Rabbit owners doing 120mph\n(nearly 200km/h) on the Autobahn, but I could be wrong.

Fuel injector \ncleaning is done properly with a can of injector cleaner solvent which is\nhooked up to the fuel system under high pressure. The car is actually run on\nthe solvent during the cleaning process. The equipment to properly do this is\npricey, and generally not something the average home mechanic has.

There has been a \ndiscussion of these products on here from time to time, and Chevron Techron\n(not Pro-Gard with Techron) is generally regarded as the best.

You will see the floppy disk and\n    hard drive mounted in a plastic tower. Follow the usual anti-static\n    precautions and of course make sure the machine is OFF when you do\n    this. Unplug the wall and monitor power supply cords from the back\n\tof the mac.\n \n3)  Remove the power supply by pulling the plastic interlocking tab on the\n    tower forward and simultaneously pulling the power supply straight up.\n    The tab is a piece of plastic from the left posterior aspect of the\n    tower which extends downward to hook on to the power supply. You may\n    also feel a horseshoe shaped piece at the right portion of the power\n    supply. Leave that alone. The plastic tab from the tower is all you\n    need release.\n \n4)  Look at the rear of the tower assembly. You will see the flat ribbon\n    SCSI connector to the hard drive, a power cable and a flat ribbon cable\n    leading to the floppy drive. Disconnect all these from the motherboard.\n    The hard drive power cable connector has a tab which must be squeezed\n    to release it.\n                                            \n5)  Unplug the drive activity LED from its clear plastic mount\n\n6)  Look down the posterior, cylindrical section of the plastic tower. A\n    phillips head screw is at the base. Remove it, taking care not to drop\n    it into the case. A bit of gummy glue on your screwdriver is helpful\n    here.\n\n7)  Remove the tower assembly by pulling medially the plastic tab on the\n    right side of the tower. This tab prevents the tower from sliding\n\tposteriorly. Slide the entire tower assembly 1 cm posteriorly then\n\tlift the tower assembly straight up and out of the case.\n\n8)  Congratulations, you have now gained access to your machine's SIMM\n    slots.\n\n9)  The six big slots are for VRAM. One usually must install all six to\n    gain useful video modes. All SIMMS (RAM or VRAM)  installed with their\n\tchips facing the front of the motherboard.\n\t\n    The four smaller sockets in front are for RAM SIMMS. Install SIMMS in\n\tsets of four into these sockets. Be sure you seat the SIMMS squarely\n\tand firmly into a fully upright position.\n\t\n10) Reinstall the tower assembly by first placing the right wall of the\n    tower against the right wall of the case with the tower assembly about\n\t1 cm posterior of its intended position. Lower the tower assembly into\n\tplace while maintaining contact with the right wall of the case.\n    Once fully down, slide the tower assembly anteriorly until it clicks\n    into place.\n\t\n11) Reconnect the motherboard ends of the cables. DONT'T FORGET THE FLOPPY\n    DRIVE CABLE.\n\n12) Replace the phillips head screw\n\n13) Drop the power supply straight down into place until it clicks in.\n\n14) Plug the hard drive activity light back into its clear plastic mount\n\nGuy Kuo <guykuo@u.washington.edu>\n\n</td><td>4</td><td>comp.sys.mac.hardware</td></tr><tr><td>From: kssimon@silver.ucs.indiana.edu (kenneth steven simon)\nSubject: Re: HELP: Need modem info for Duo 210\nSummary: very hard to get a modem \nNntp-Posting-Host: silver.ucs.indiana.edu\nOrganization: Indiana University\nLines: 34\n\n  jdsiegel@garnet.berkeley.edu (Joel Siegel) writes:\n\n  jmilhoan@magnus.acs.ohio-state.edu (JT) writes:\n\n  >Hi... what alternatives to the Express modem do Duo owners have (if\n  >they want to go at least 9600 baud)?\n\n  >Every place in town says they are back ordered, and part of the reason\n  >I want a laptop mac is so I can use it as a remote terminal from\n  >wherever I am, but I really would hate to have to wait 2 months to get\n  >a modem in or have to settle with 2400 baud.\n\nIf Apple didn't put out such a good product -- I'd gladly take my\nbusiness to -- to -- the 8-bit Ataris.

The problem occurs when\nthe processor bus errors trying to access the SCSI chip when the next byte\nhasn't been clocked yet.

Some boxes have internal terminators; some can be switched out and\nothers are socketted.  These count.  If the box with internal terminations\ncannot be put on the end to terminate the cabling, they have to be\ndisabled, ie, switched out or pulled out of their sockets.

According to the latest MacLeak, the \ndrive has a 14.5 ms access time, 1.9 MB/s sustained throughput (these figures\nare from memory so they could be slightly off, but they give you an idea of\nperformance nonetheless). The drive was originally released for the PC\nand just recently was released for the Mac world (don't ask me what the \ndifferences are) and through they are currently in limited supply, according\nto a Syquest rep. they are in the process of ramping up for mass production.\nI have already seen them advertised by a number of manufacturers in MacLeak\nincluding PLI, MassMicro, ClubMac, and MacWarehouse's PowerUser.

The relevant parts are:\n\n  922-0358  blank bezel faceplate\n  922-0850  CD-ROM carrier [i.e., generic 5.25\" device mounting bracket]\n\nNote Apple's unfortunate choice of name for the slide-in bracket to\nmount a 5.25\" device.  The service techs I talked to said, \"Oh sure,\nwe stock those.\"  Of course they were thinking of the CD caddies to\nhold a CD disk when you stick it in the drive.\n\nAs far as I can tell, Apple does not sell a bezel faceplate already\ncut out for a standard 5.25\" device.  (Why not?  They advertise\nthese machines as being able to accept any standard device in the\n5.25\" bay, why not provide the faceplate?)   They do sell a cutout for\ntheir CD-ROM drive (of course), but that's of no use.\n\nI'm going to hack up the extra bezel I ordered to make a cutout for my\ntape drive, which is a standard 5.25\" device.\n\nGood luck with your SyQuest.\n\n\t-Fred\n\n\n</td><td>4</td><td>comp.sys.mac.hardware</td></tr><tr><td>From: jaker@csugrad.cs.vt.edu (Jacob Rose)\nSubject: Re: Position of 'b' on Erg.

The accelerator costs about $1400 whereas\nthe upgrade costs $2131 (just quoted from my dealer).  However the Q700\nupgrade gives you very fast built in video that supports monitors up to 21\"\nwith 8 bit depth and up to 16\" at 24 bit depth (with additional VRAM).  It\nalso has a SCSI port capable of a much faster throughput than the CI, which\nmakes a big difference if you have a fast hard drive.\n\n  If the improved video and SCSI features are important to you, you're\nbetter off getting the Q700 upgrade, otherwise save some money and get an\naccelerator.\n\nPaul\n</td><td>4</td><td>comp.sys.mac.hardware</td></tr><tr><td>From: jartsu@hut.fi (Jartsu)\nSubject: Good display card for 14\" multisync?\nNntp-Posting-Host: lk-hp-20.hut.fi\nReply-To: jartsu@vipunen.hut.fi\nOrganization: Helsinki University of Technology, Finland\nLines: 20\n\n\nHi there!\n\nI wonder if anyone knows and can recommend me a good NuBus display\ncard for driving a 14\" multisync (NEC 3D)?\nThe NEC 3D can do horizontal refresh from 15.5 kHz to 38 kHz and\nvertical from 50 Hz to 90 Hz and can do max 1024x768 interlaced,\nthough I am looking for something more like 800x600 or 832x624\nnoninterlaced.\nIt would be very nice to find a card which can be programmed quite\nfreely within these limits and is capable to display at least\n8bits/pixel, preferably more.\n\nIs there anything on the market that comes even close?\n\n\nThanks\n\n--\nJartsu\n</td><td>4</td><td>comp.sys.mac.hardware</td></tr><tr><td>From: blast@nntp.crl.com (Tim Keanini)\nSubject: Mac SCSI spec?\nLines: 20\nNNTP-Posting-Host: crl.com\n\nI have a MacIIFX and I know that it is wired about its SCSI chain.\n\nI just bought a drive and I need to find out a few hardcore SCSI question:\n\nDoes the IIFX SCSI chain want to see active or passive termination?\n\nDoes the IIFX SCSI spec want me to enable the initiation of the SDTR message?\n\nWHat does the IIFX SCSI spec want as far as parity checking?\n\nThese are some very good questions for the FAQ.       \nIf someone does not have time to answer these questions but does know \nwhere I can look them up please let me know and I will repost the answers\nfor everyone to see.\n\nthanks,\n\nTim Keanini        <timk@broder.com>  or  <blast@crl.com>\nSound Engineer         Broderbund Software\n\n</td><td>4</td><td>comp.sys.mac.hardware</td></tr><tr><td>From: d88-jwa@hemul.nada.kth.se (Jon Wätte)\nSubject: Re: Interesting ADB behaviour on C650\nNntp-Posting-Host: hemul.nada.kth.se\nOrganization: Royal Institute of Technology, Stockholm, Sweden\nLines: 23\n\nIn <1993Apr16.091202.15500@waikato.ac.nz> ldo@waikato.ac.nz (Lawrence D'Oliveiro, Waikato University) writes:\n\n>I have heard of no such warnings from anybody at Apple.

(random access memory boards for Apple\nMacintosh PowerBook Duos) \nMacWEEK v7, n7 (Feb 15, 1993):132.\n\nCOPYRIGHT Coastal Associates Publishing L.P. 1993\n\nBy Raines Cohen\n\n     Austin, Texas - Some third-party memory-expansion cards for PowerBook\nDuos depart from Apple specs in ways that could cause crashes, data loss\nand other problems.\n\n     Technology Works Inc., a RAM and network vendor based here, last week\nissued a warning about three problems it said it had found in Duo RAM\nproducts from some competing vendors, which it declined to identify.\nOther vendors and an Apple spokeswoman confirmed that the problems exist.\n\n     > Self-refresh.  The Duos require a kind of dynamic RAM called\nselfrefreshing, which can recharge itself while the system sleeps.  But\nTechnology Works said some vendors have sold Duo cards with\nnonselfrefreshing DRAM, which can cause the system to lose data or fail to\nwake from sleep.\n\n     Most leading memory manufacturers include the letter V in the part\nnumber stamped on their self-refreshing chips; nonself-refreshing chips\ninstead have an L, according to TechWorks.  The chip label, however, may\nnot tell the whole story.  Newer Technology of Wichita, Kan., said it uses\nnonself-refreshing chips but adds its own circuitry to keep them refreshed\nwhile the Duo sleeps.\n\n     > Speed.  Some RAM-card vendors have put 80-nanosecond DRAM on Duo\ncards rather than the 70-nanosecond type the 230 requires, Technology\nWorks said.  However, some chips labeled as 80- or 85-nanosecond are\ncertified by the manufacturer to run at a higher speed.\n\n     Kingston Technology Corp. of Fountain Valley, Calif., said it offers\nDuo RAM cards with 80-nanosecond chips, but only for the Duo 210, which is\ncompatible with the slower chips.\n\n     > Space.  Technology Works charged and Apple officials confirmed that\nsome third-party cards are too large to fit properly, forcing the corner\nof the Duo keyboard up and preventing the system from starting up normally\nwhen in a Duo Dock.\n\n     Lifetime Memory Products Inc. of Huntington Beach, Calif., said it\noriginally shipped cards with this problem but has since offered all\ncustomers free upgrades to cards that fit.\n\n</td><td>4</td><td>comp.sys.mac.hardware</td></tr><tr><td>From: chyang@leghorn.engin.umich.edu (Chung Hsiung Yang)\nSubject: Re: CD300 & 300i\nOrganization: University of Michigan Engineering, Ann Arbor\nLines: 28\nDistribution: world\nNNTP-Posting-Host: leghorn.engin.umich.edu\nOriginator: chyang@leghorn.engin.umich.edu\n\n\nIn article <bauer-060493101758@134.60.68.23>, bauer@informatik.uni-ulm.de (Christian Bauer) writes:\n> In article <Afi9sHS00VohMrYlEe@andrew.cmu.edu>, \"Donpaul C.

I took it in to the dealer and they replaced\nthe entire assembly.  It happened to the other one about 3 months later.

I haven't noticed water in the taillamps (or the trunk) for the last 2.5\nyears, but just last month, the taillamp just fogged up again.  I'm going to try\nto take it back to get them to fix it again.  I'm real tempted to drill some vent\nand drain holes in the tops and bottoms of the assembly and forget about it.  This is\ngetting very annoying.

Two bolts attach it to the  \nengine compartment.  Two brake lines enter the master cylinder.  The tricky  \npart was that the brake lines were stuck tight.  My Craftsmen open end wrench  \nrounded off the bolt heads!  I had to use Vise Grips to loosen those suckers.   \nWow!  Best invention since sliced bread.  After that it was very easy.  Bolt  \nthe new part in place, add new brake fluid, and bleed the brakes.\n\nThis is quite easy even for a beginner.

Latchkey children are everywhere!\n And these latchkey kids can watch whatever rotten videos and listen to\n whatever violent hate-promoting \"music\" and videos they like because no\n one is home to stop it.\n\n  This day and age, when there is about 100 times more things to learn\n than when I went to school, our answer to this increased knowledge is\n shorter school hours and more leisure time!  I say keep the kids in\n school longer, feed them good food and teach them something, and when\n they get home, have a parent there to interact and monitor them.  There\n is a very old and now forgotten proverb: a child left on his own will\n bring a parent to grief.  Daycare systems are not the answer.  This is\n just shifting the parents' own responsibilities off on someone else to\n whom it's not a life-long committment, but rather just a job.\n\n\n# \n#AT\n\n  Followups should go to alt.parents-teens\n\n\n Fred W.

The keywords `Monthly Posting'\nwill always appear to make killing this article easy for users of\nnewsreaders with kill facilities.  This article is posted to all autos\ngroups, but followups are directed only to rec.autos.  If you don't\nunderstand what this means, ask your system administrator for help, or at\nleast for copies of the newuser documentation.  Failing that, please\nsubscribe to the newsgroup news.announce.newusers and read the\ndocumentation provided there.\n\nIntroduction to the Rec.Autos newsgroup hierarchy:\n\nrec.autos.tech\n\nis intended for technical discussions of automobiles, their design,\nconstruction, diagnosis, and service.  Other discussions are largely\ninappropriate, especially For Sale ads.\n\nrec.autos.sport\n\nis intended for discussion of legal, organized competition involving\nautomobiles.  Technical discussions are appropriate insofar as they apply\nto competition vehicles.  Discussion from either of two viewpoints,\nspectator and participant, is encouraged.  Arguments about sports cars are\nlargely inappropriate, as are most other discussions.  For Sale ads are\ninappropriate unless they are for competition vehicles and/or equipment.\nDiscussions of illegal events are marginal; one should probably avoid\nadvocating breaking the law.  (remember, the FBI reads Usenet!)\n\nrec.autos.driving\n\nis intended for discussions related to the driving of automobiles.\nAlso, if you must discuss 55 vs. 65, or radar detectors, or <insert\nyour pet driving peeve> boneheads, do it here.\n\nrec.autos.vw\n\nis intended for discussion of issues related to the use and ownership\nof automobiles manufactured by Volkswagen (this includes VWs, Audis,\nSeats, etc.)  It was created on the grounds that the info-vw mailing\nlist was very successful.  It should not be presumed from the existence\nof this group that it is appropriate to create many groups to cover many\ndifferent marques; groups specific to individual marques should only be\ncreated on demonstration of sufficient interest, via some avenue such as\na mailing list.\n\nrec.audio.car\n\nis not properly part of the rec.autos.* hierarchy.  it is, however,\nthe correct place for discussion of automotive audio equipment, and\nso is mentioned here.\n\nrec.autos.antique\n\nis intended for the discussion of older cars (usually more than 25 years\nold, although this is not a hard-and-fast rule.)\n\nalt.hotrod\n\nis not part of the hierarchy, but also of potential interest to the\nrec.autos reader.  it is gatewayed to the moderated hotrod mailing\nlist, and is for serious discussion of modifying and developing\nperformance vehicles.\n\nalt.autos.rod-n-custom\n\nalso not part of the `official' hierarchy; devoted to that peculiar\nAmerican hobby of customizing older cars.\n\nalt.autos.karting\n\nfor the discussion of the popular motorsport and hobby, karting.\n\nrec.autos\n\nis intended to capture discussion on all other automotive topics.\n\n\nCrossposting:\n\nCrossposting occurs when more than one newsgroup name is included on\nthe Newsgroups: line in the article header; such articles will appear\nin all of the newsgroups listed.\n\nCrossposting is one of the most misunderstood and misused facilities on\nUsenet.  You should only post to a group because you feel an article is\nappropriate; you should NEVER crosspost just to reach a particular\naudience.  This distinction is subtle, but important.  Radar Detector\narticles, for example, are more-or-less appropriate in rec.autos.  They are\nalmost never appropriate in sci.electronics or rec.ham-radio, and the fact\nthat you might want to reach the audience in sci.electronics or\nrec.ham-radio is NOT adequate justification for posting to either group.\n\nCrossposting between any or all of the rec.autos.* groups is usually\ninappropriate; if you find yourself doing so, consider whether or not it is\ntruly advisable, before sending your article.  Consider setting Followup-To:\nto point to only one newsgroup if you feel you must crosspost.\n\nCrossposting between rec.autos.* and misc.consumers is chancy at best; in\nparticular flame wars over the speed limit in the US and/or the use of\nradar detectors should NEVER be crossposted between any of these groups.\n\nMost readers of sci.electronics and rec.radio.* couldn't care less about\nthe police radar and radar detector arguments that go on endlessly in\nrec.autos.\n\nIt is an excellent idea to check the Newsgroups: and Followup-to:  lines of\narticles before posting a followup.  In particular, be wary of posting to\nmisc.test, rec.arts.startrek.*, or talk.bizarre, or any combination of these\nthree.  The life you save may be your own.\n\nDistribution:\n\nThere is a field in the header of any news article which allows you to\n(partially) control where the article goes; it is called the Distribution\nfield.  It may be very useful for many reasons; it should also serve\nas a reminder that news is a very large and widespread system.\n\nThe distribution of rec.autos.* is fairly extensive.  As of this writing, \nthe Automotive newsgroups are known to reach most of Europe, Australia,\nNew Zealand, and some locations in Japan.  With this in mind, I offer the\nfollowing hints about use of the Distribution: field in your article\nheaders, and on article content.\n\n1) Please take care not to send for-sale ads about clapped out Ford\nMavericks in New Jersey to France or California; i doubt that anyone in\neither place will care, except for my girlfriend, who for some strange\nreason likes Mavericks (but only 4-door Mavericks, at that.)\n\n2) When posting technical questions, please include the market for which\nyour car was manufactured.  For example, there are a number of differences\nbetween a European-market Ford Escort and a US-market Escort.  Likewise,\nall 1750cc and early 2000cc Alfa Romeos reached the US with Spica Fuel\ninjection; European market cars usually got carbs (often Webers).  These\ndifferences can be important to your readers; make your situation clear.\nFailure to do so can lead to pointless flame wars and a significant\nspread of misinformation.\n\n3) Be careful about your capacities and specifications when posting;\nin the US we get a mix of Metric and English system values, whereas\nEurope is almost entirely on the Metric system.  A future edition\nof this monthly posting will contain a list of commonly-used\nabbreviations that may not be known in some places that rec.autos\nreaches; this cuts both ways so let us not be parochial about it.\n\n4) Use the Distribution: field to limit where your article goes, when\npossible.  Within North America, the values na (north america), can\n(canada), and usa may be used.  in addition, the two-letter state\nabbreviations of the US are supported in some cases; e.g. if i wanted\nto send an article only to New York and New Jersey, i could put\n\"ny,nj\" in a Distribution field.  note that multiple, comma-separated\nvalues are legal.  these distribution fields vary widely, however, so\nyou should check with your local sysadmin to find out what is likely\nto be supported in your area.\n\nThe Dangers of Overgeneralization:\n\nTo amplify a warning from the distribution section of this article:\nBe wary of making foolish assumptions about all cars, tires, etc.  What is\ntrue for a 1973 Buick with a 455cid engine may be quite utterly wrong for a\n1976 Honda with a 1200cc engine.  Headlight laws in Sweden are decidedly\ndifferent from those in Idaho.\n\nThe Need for Adequate Specification:\n\nWhen you ask a question, please give a reasonable amount of information;\ne.g., if you have a question about your Honda, please specify year,\nmodel, engine size, etc.  Otherwise, most answers to your question may be\nquite useless.\n\n\nConcerning Lemons:\n\nAt one time or another, every auto manufacturer has manufactured a lemon or\ntwo; even Honda admits to this.  Please don't waste everyone's time by\nannouncing to the world that your `brand x' automobile is terrible, so all\n`brand x' automobiles are terrible, so no one should ever buy a car from\nthe `brand x' company.  Such articles are worse than useless, because they\ncause substantial wasted bandwidth while carrying little or no useful\ninformation.\n\n\nConcerning Flames:\n\nAs much as we might wish it, a flame-free newsgroup is something that most\nlikely will never occur.  Here are some guidelines for flames and how\nto deal with them (a list of flame-prone topics follows in the next section\nof this posting):\n\nIf you post something truly obnoxious and inflammatory, don't imagine for a\nminute that including the words `No Flames' will work.  It won't, and\nyou'll get exactly what you deserve.\n\nIf you're going to flame, you're more likely to get away with it if you can\ncite a fact or maybe a well-known reference.  No one is likely to believe\nbald, unsupported assertions.\n\nBe careful about who you choose to insult.  Consider not insulting anyone.\n\n\nAsking the Question:\n\nIt is a bad idea to post a question and end it with a phrase like `Please\nsend email, I don't read this group'.  It is a much better idea to\nend the question with `Please send email, if there is sufficient interest\nI'll summarize the results in a later posting.  I may miss posted responses\nto this request'.\n\nAnswering the Question:\n\nIf someone wants to hop up their Yugo, don't tell them to get a Mustang.\nEither be silent, or give them useful advice.  If someone wants advice on\ndefending a speeding ticket, don't tell them to obey the law next time --\nit's offensive, presumes guilt which is not proven, and doesn't directly\naddress the original question.  In general, don't post in order to see\nyour words in print, and don't post in order to enjoy feeling smug and\nself-righteous.\n\n\nStale and/or Inflammatory Topics:\n\nCertain topics are considered stale by `old timers'; while discussion of\nthem is certainly ok, and new, factual information is welcome, ravings\nabout them are extremely tiresome, and may get the person who posts them\nignored altogether.  Some topics are naturally inflammatory; it is\ndifficult if not impossible to have meaningful discussion of them.  Some\nof these topics include the following:\n\n1)  the 55mph speed limit in the US: Pro and Con\n\n2)  discussions about the morality and legality of the sale and usage of\n    radar detectors.\n\n3)  discussions over which radar detector is best.\n\n4)  discussions over what is a sports car (this is one reason why\n    rec.autos.sport is not a `sports car' group -- everyone would argue\n    about what constitutes a `sports car'.)\n\n5)  disputes over whether or not US Federal law protects the driver's\n    right to own and operate a radar detector\n\n6)  `Buy American' discussions\n\n7)  `clever' bumper stickers and personalized license plates\n\n8)  <insert nationality here> cars are terrible\n\n9)  What kind of car did Maxwell Smart drive?\n      [when I have a complete, accurate answer it will be added to the\n          commonly-asked questions article which is also posted monthly.\n          Until then, please don't waste bandwidth on this topic. -- rpw]\n\n\n\nPlease direct comments and suggestions about this article to:\n\n     welty@cabot.balltown.cma.com\n-- \nrichard welty        518-393-7228       welty@cabot.balltown.cma.com\n``Nothing good has ever been reported about the full rotation of\n  a race car about either its pitch or roll axis''  -- Carroll Smith\n</td><td>7</td><td>rec.autos</td><td>Archive-name: rec-autos/part1</td><td>[most recent changes, 15 March 1993: addition of alt.autos.karting -- rpw]</td><td>72</td></tr><tr><td>From: tcorkum@bnr.ca (Trevor Corkum)\nSubject: Is car saftey important? \nNntp-Posting-Host: 47.141.0.88\nReply-To: tcorkum@bnr.ca (Trevor Corkum)\nOrganization: Bell-Northern Research Ltd.\nLines: 11\n\n   I was recently thumbing through the 1993 Lemon-Aid New\nCar Guide.

Oils that are designed for operation in exceedingly\ncold temperatures have a `W' tacked on the end, so in winter in a cold\nplace, you'd stick 10W in your car in the winter and 40 in it in the summer,\nto approximate the appropriate viscosity throughout the year.\n\nModern multi-viscosity oils change viscosity much less with temperature.\nAs a result, their viscosity graphs cross over several curves.  A multi-vis\nspecification pegs the curve at two temperatures, a `normal' operating\ntemperature and a `cold' one (though I can't remember the numbers...).\n\nIn any event, the weights do indicate a significant difference.  Remember\nthat your engine is temperature-regulated (by the thermostat and\nradiator or air fins) most of the time -- unless you overheat it or\nsomething.\n\nAny weight of oil is better than no oil, or than very old, carbonized\noil.  Thin oil won't (in general) lubricate as well at temperature,\nthicker oil will (like a 20W50) will lubricate better at temperature, \nbut not as well during startup, when most engine wear occurs.  \n\nIf you're planning on making long drives, the 20W50 is probably fine\n(esp. in the summer) in your 10W40 car.

An on-the-road rally where participants are given a set of\n      directions and clues guiding participates around the \n      Joliet/Plainfield area.  The object is to navigate a course\n      based on a set of directions and clues.  Participants will\n      be given a set of questions pertaining to the course which\n      they must answer along the way.  Points are awarded for the\n      number of correct answers given.  Directions will ultimately \n      lead to an off-road area where a four-wheel drive course is \n      set-up.  At various locations in the on-road course, check-points\n      will be set-up where participants will be asked other questions\n      or requested to perform some activity (e.g. tire roll, truck tow,\n      basketball free-throw, etc.) for additional points.\n\n   2. An optional off-road, four wheel drive course where participants\n      will navigate off-road trails, mud bogs and/or hill climbs.\n      Points are awarded for successfully navigating off-road obstacles\n      without getting stuck.  If you should get stuck (which is half\n      the fun anyway), there will be assistance to get your vehicle\n      unstuck so you can try it again.  The off-road course will\n      divided up based on tire size, so stock 4x4s as well as modified\n      4x4s can run the course.\n     \n  At the end of the rally, trophies will be awarded to top scoring\n  participants.  Door prizes and dash plaques will also be given out.\n  Food and drinks also available at the conclusion.\n\n* This is an organized activity sponsored by the Joliet Mud Turtles\n  so safety and fun is our foremost concern.

I have no idea how either of my Hondas will handle at 100+ mph,\nnor do they reach 155. However, using `high' to be 70-90 mph:\n\na) They are quite amenable to long high speed drives. I've done several\n1k mile+ trips in my Civic with no problems whatsoever. The last big trip\nI made was driving from New York to Texas. I remember driving 700-800\nmiles a day at typically 75-85 mph  without any problems. I'm sure I  \nwould have been more comfortable driving a benz, but no white knuckles.\nNo problems with winds and curves. \n\nThen there was the trip back from New Orleans after Mardi Gras - where\nwe were doing 80+ all the way to Houston. No problems.\n\nb) Both my cars have surprising good fuel economy at high speeds. I see\nno difference between sustained 60 mph and sustained 80mph. On the trip\nback from New Orleans, we got about 30 mpg in my Integra, quite ok. Mind\nyou, the engine revs to almost 4k at 80. The civic is markedly better\nthan the Integra in fuel economy. 50k miles down the road, I still\nget 35 mpg at 70-75 mph driving.\n\n\n>|> b) I can't understand why these high-scale European marquees are afraid\n>|>    to design engines that can be repeatedly revved to near redline in\n>|>    the low gears.

My car has 11,500\nmiles on it and is a '92 model.  The NX2000 the dealer is selling is a '91\nmodel with 23,000miles on it.  It has a T-Bar Roof, a/c, and an airbag,\nwhich my Sentra does not have.  They are asking for $1500.  Is that a fair\ndeal?  The only thing I noticed about the NX2000 is that the engine did not\nseem to have as much torque as my Sentra which has the same identical\nengine.  I presume that the last lady owner did not really push the engine\nto it's limits occassionaly while I did that on mine, thuis the NX2000's\nengine is a little \"tight.\"  So, if I buy the NX2000 and \"excercise\" it\nwell, should that slight power problem go away?

I can name a number of\ninterstate highways in various parts of the country where 130 would be\nvery optimistic in any car.\n\nI'm not sure what you call \"quite severe\" in terms of road deviations\nbut I suspect every single bridge junction on I84 through CT would be\nconsidered so.

That's not the only\ninterstate I've seen with such deviations, but it's one I drive\nfrequently.\n\nTexas is pretty much an edge-case -- you can't assume that everywhere\nhas roads in such good condition, such flat terrain, and such\nwide-open spaces.

In two weeks I will be returning to Texas (my\nhome) from my school (BYU) in Provo, Utah.  As you can imagine, trying to\ndrive nearly 1300 miles with a broken right ankle isn't just the epitome of\na good time.  My car does not have a cruise control, so I would have to do\nall the pedalling (ha ha) with my messed-up ankle.\n\nMy question:\nWhat is the general opinion of after-market cruise control units?  I\nrealize that a cheap CC (cruise control) from, say, Pep Boys, isn't going to\nbe as good as a factory or professionally installed unit (if there is such a\nthing).  And I uderstand that I probably can't expect much in the way of\naccuracy, looks and that sort of thing;  But anything's gotta be better than\ntrying to drive with a hosed ankle.\n\nI have a 1984 Jeep Cherokee, 4 speed, standard, 4*4, 2.5L engine with\nkettering(sp?) ignition (y'know, distributor cap, rotor, that set-up--not\nelectronic.  Maybe you could've guessed it being an '84, but I'm just trying\nto give information as completly as I can).\n\nI found a CC unit for 80 bucks.  It seems to use the vehicles vacuum system \ninstead of an electric servor/motor.  Is this good or bad?  If I did buy\nthis CC, which vacuum hose should I tap?\n\nIt has two speed sensors:  One magnetic, and one that gets a signal from the \nnegative side of the distributor, kinda like a tach pick-up, or so I\nunderstand.  I can use either one.  Which is best?  The manual says (I read\nit in the store today) that the magnetic/axle set-up is more accurate, but\nharder to install.  Is there really a big difference?\n\nIt has a sensor for the brake pedal, just like other CCs, but does NOT have a\nsensor for the clutch pedal.  So if I wasn't paying real close attention I\nmight push the clutch in while the cruise is trying to get the speed up.  Which\nwould wind the engine up kinda high until I got my wits about me and turned \nthe thing off.  I'm pretty coordinated, so this doesn't bother me, if it\nwere for my girlfriends car, *then* it would bother me, but I'm ok with it.\n\nThe installation also calls for an attachment to a steady-on brake signal\nand a switched-on brake signal.  I think I can get a switched brake signal\nfrom the correct side of the brake light blade fuse.  Am I right?  But I'm\nnot sure where to get the steady-on brake signal, or, for that matter, what\nexactly it is?  Any ideas as to what the manufaturer wants and where to get\nit?\n\nI think I can figure the other things out.  Like how to hook-up the negative\nside tach-type sensing gizmo and the cabin control unit, and the ground and\nall that miscellaneous business.  But I need a little help with:\n\n\t1.  Is it worth the money and safety risk (if any) for such a\n\t    device?\n\t2.  Is there any particularly good after-market CC?\n\t3.  Are \"professionally\" installed CCs signifacantly better and\n\t    worth the cabbage?\n\t4.  If the unit I saw (sorry, no manufacturer or model number, just\n\t    that it is at Pep Boy and its $80) is sufficient for my simple \n\t    needs, how do I get the thing installed properly (specifically,\n\t    the questions above)?\n\nMy father and I built a \"Veep\" (Volkswagen powered Jeep CJ-2A) when I was in\nhigh school, so I consider myself fairly good with tools, electronics, and\ncars.  So the installation doesn't scare me.  I just want to be certain that\nI get the thing installed correctly as my Cherokee is just a wee bit more\ncomplicated than my Veep. :-)\n\nI appreciate your time in reading my post, and I would appreciate any\nexpertise or opinion anybody has on the subject.  If you would like to share\nsome of your wisdom, please email as I don't get over this group very often\n(but I check my mail all the time).\n\nAgain, thanks for any help anyone may have.\n\nMike Wieda\nMikew@canc.byu.edu\n\n</td><td>7</td><td>rec.autos</td><td>Howdy,</td><td>I'm a little new to this newsgroup, but I would like to tap some of the\nknowledge and expertise available here.</td><td>124</td></tr><tr><td>From: hkon@athena.mit.edu (Henry Kon)\nSubject: 83 tercel sunroof leaks - arrggh\nOrganization: Massachusetts Institute of Technology\nLines: 14\nDistribution: world\nNNTP-Posting-Host: e40-008-11.mit.edu\n\nIS there a simple way tooput these sunroofs out of their misery - \ndo leaks tend to be from old gaskets ?  \nor from inadequate mechanical seals - \nor all of the above ??\n\nis there any way to halt the rain ?\n\nthanks\nhk\n--\nHenry Bruno Kon\noffice: 617-253-2781 (with machine)\nhome:   617-625-3972 (with machine)\n\n</td><td>7</td><td>rec.autos</td><td>IS there a simple way tooput these sunroofs out of their misery - \ndo leaks tend to be from old gaskets ?  \nor from inadequate mechanical seals - \nor all of the above ??</td><td>is there any way to halt the rain ?</td><td>125</td></tr><tr><td>From: smith@ctron.com (Lawrence C Smith)\nSubject: Re: MR2 - noisy engine.\nOrganization: Cabletron Systems, Inc.\nLines: 16\nDistribution: world\nReply-To: smith@ctron.com\nNNTP-Posting-Host: glinda.ctron.com\n\nIn article <Apr21.053718.19765@engr.washington.edu>, eliot@lanmola.engr.washington.edu (eliot) writes:\n\n>if the noise really bugs you, there is nothing else that you can do\n>except to sell it and get a V6.\n\nPerhaps a nice used '88 Pontiac Fiero GT?  2.8 liters.\n\nDoes anyone know if the motor mounts for the 2.8 and the twin-dual-cam 3.4\nliter match?

My 1975 Saab 99\ndidn't have them, but a friend's 1978 Saab 99 certainly did.  In addition\nto the confentional tail-light mounted backup lights, they had another\nset integrated into the front turn signal assembly.  For those of you who\ndon't remember, Saabs of that vintage had an enormous multicoloured plastic\ngrowth, about the size of a _National Geographic_ magazine, sticking out\nof the front fender, which incorporated amber \"parking lights\", amber side\nmarker lights/reflectors, white \"cornering lamps\" (like American luxury\ncars) aimed towards the side of the road when you have your turn indicators\non, and white \"backup lights\" aimed towards the back of the car when you\nhave selected reverse gear.  The glossy brochure showed how these front\nmounted backup lights were useful for illuminating hazards (pot holes, kid's\ntoys, etc) that would be run over by the front of the car if you had the\nwheels turned while backing up.\n\nMart L.

The problem is that the car has \naftermarket tint on all windows except the windshield. The tint is rather\nweak, and you can clearly see the inside of the car through the tint.\n\nThe inspection garage said that they won't pass it unless I get a\nwaiver from the state police. So I went to the state police - the\nofficer told me that aftermarket tint is illegal, and I can get a\nwaiver only for a pre-84 car or for a medical reason. I asked him to\nshow me the section of the vehicle code that says it's illegal.  He\nshowed it to me and the paraghaph said that you can't have tint, if\nyou can't see the inside of the car because of the tint. When I told\nhim that you can in fact see the inside very well, he shut the book\nand said \"It's just illegal, and in fact we can have someone give you\na ticket for it right now.\" Well, won't argue with that...\n\nSince the vehicle code says it's OK as long as you can see through the\ntint, I'd like to keep it (I'll re-read the vehicle code in the\nlibrary).  I'd also like to get some sort of paper from the police\nthat says it's OK, so I can get the inspection, and so that I won't\nget in trouble for the tint later on. I also wouldn't mind registering\na complaint against that officer - he really pissed me off.\n\nSo does anyone have any experience getting that sort of a paper from\nthe police, especially in Pennsylvania? Does anyone have any experience\nregistering a complaint against an officer? I called the station \nlater on today, but they basically said there is no place where I\ncould register a complaint against an officer... And if I do decide\nto keep the tint and get a ticket anyway, how much of a chance do\nI stand to succesfully appeal the ticket in court?\n\nAny comments about it will be welcome!\n\nMichal\n\n</td><td>7</td><td>rec.autos</td><td>I know it's a long shot, but maybe someone went through this and will have\nsome comments to share.</td><td>The story is this: I bought a car out of state, and I'm trying to get\nthe safety inspection in Pennsylvania.

I believed\nthis and to put it nicely, it was a piece of junk!\n\nI loved this car, I babied it, I pampered it, and after 2 years, it just\ncouldn't stay together, I would say that not everyone will have the\nproblems that I had, but know this, it's not just the car, it is the\nability to get the car fixed, which will NOT happen at any\nchrysler/dodge/take your pick dealer.  I don't care if there are going to\nreform their dealers/service with the intro of the LH cars, I will believe\nit when I see it.  Case and point, the local dodge dealer.  You drive up,\njust looking, you don't even get out of your door, when about 10 (yes 10)\nsalesman all eye you like their next meal, and literally pounce on you,\nand try to get you to make a deal, on everything your eye wanders towards.\nService is about 2 times worse than that.  I had an alignment problem, but\nthey tried to tell me that the K frame was bent, and about 2000 dollars of\nwork/parts to fix it.  Let me tell you the problems I had, and I took care\nof this car, I put alot of miles on it in the first couple years, but took\nit to every checkup it needed, and many that shouldn't have been.\n\n1988 Dodge Shadow ES\n\nThese were replaced within the 4 years that I owned the car.\n\nEngine \n4 Alternators\nRear Suspension Torsion Bar\n2 Water pumps\n5 thermostats\nHall effect sensor\nMain computer\n4 Batteries\n\nThese were rebuilt/repaired\n\nRadiator\nAutomatic Transmission\nPower Steering\n\n\nThose are just the things I can remember off the top of my head.  For\nabout a year before I sold the car, I said to myself, it's a good car, I\njust can't find anybody competent enough the fix it.  In the end, before I\ntraded it in for a Saturn, the power steering started acting up again.  I\njust stopped putting money into it.  I must have put at least $5000-$7000\nworth of repairs over it's lifetime.  I am sorry but Lee Iacocca can bite\nme.  Bullshit, whoever backs em best, is just afraid the stupid things are\ngoing to fall apart, and no one will buy them without assurance, why the\nhell do you think that LH has been nicknamed Last Hope.\n\nYou can do better, and I know people will disagree with me here, but\nJapanese, like Honda, or Toyota, or the only american car company that I\nfeel is a quality product, Saturn.  I will not touch another chrysler\nproduct again, no way.  I don't care how good the LH cars look good, and I\nwill admit they look promising, but not with the support that you get.  GM\nisn't much better, thank god, they don't control Saturn, like they do\ntheir divisions, or it would be just another marketing ploy.  \n\nDon't get me wrong, i will be watching my car (which I do like) like a\nhawk for the next 4 years.  I am much more hesitant to say it (or any) car\nis really good, until it has proved itself to me.\n\nBut since someone else pointed out C&D as a source.  I will note, because\nI used to read these magazines, that Car and Driver has never had a good\nthing to say about most Chrysler products (Shadow for one), always were\nthey moaning about the reguritated K-car, and engine.  Whereas Motor Trend\nalways thought they were great cars.  No car magazine is really objective.\n\nAnd although there are alot of people who don't like Consumers Reports, I\nwill use them to reinforce my argument (I already know about the big stink\nwith the Saturn crash tests, time will tell how good a car they are), the\nshadow/sundance rate much worse than average, in fact none of the\nchrysler's rate a better than average, I think the best one is just\naverage.  Excluding the diamond star/mitsubishi stuff and the LH's.  You\ncan find bad stuff about the Shadow.  Try as I might, when I researched\nthe Saturn, I could not find anything bad about it.  There is a great deal\nof information about this company, just because it is a new american\ncompany and it has created quite a stir in the automotive community, for\ngood reason.  Much more than the introduction of any new model lines of\nany established company.  I read an article, which had a sub-column, an I\nthink this imprinted on me more than anything else.  Some big wig in\nToyota said and I quote, \"We are watching them very closely.\"  Come on,\neverybody grow up, the foreign cars, especially the japanese have been\nkicking our butts, for good reason, the american car companies could not make\na good product or support the customer the way they want these days, to\nset in their ways, which is one of the reasons Saturn was created.  They\nare still struggling because they haven't learned yet.  They have the\nability, the workers are not inferior, the technology is not out of date,\nbut their attitude is, and they are just finding this out.  It's called\ncompetition gentleman/women if you don't satisfy the demand of the\nconsumer, well your out..  \n\n*asbestos suit on*\n\nGaia\n\n</td><td>7</td><td>rec.autos</td><td>In article <oprsfnx.735015349@gsusgi1.gsu.edu> oprsfnx@gsusgi2.gsu.edu (Stephen F.

The lockup only\noccurs at light throttle settings and serves only to improve MPG.

Years ago in another\ntime and place, I used to do oil changes in boats powered by automotive\nengines.  In many cases, there was no way to get any sort of a tray under\nthe oil pan because it was boxed in by the bottom of the hull and various\nfloation chambers on each side.  And if you *did* get something there, you'd\nspill all the oil out of it for sure trying to get it back out again.\n\nSo we used a small pump powered by an electric drill to suck the oil out\nthe dipstick hole.  There was a long/thin hose on the inlet side designed\nto fit down the dipstick tube, and another, thicker/shorter hose on the\noutlet side that you put into any convenient container.  I'm sure these\ngadgets are still available from marine hardware suppliers if you want one.\n\nMart L.

A good used car buy.\nThe MX-6 was almost there but rolled more than I liked.  \nI didn't like the Prelude dash/instrumentation at all.  Too weird for me.\nThe MR2 has a much smaller non-passenger space than I needed, so out that went.\nThe Celica was \"ok\" but underpowered when loaded with options (and somewhat\noverpriced too) in non-turbo form.\nI never considered the 240SX since it didn't have an airbag.  I did look at it\nfor its RWD virtues but that's it.  The Corolla never entered my mind.\nI should have looked at the Mitsubishi VR4/Dodge Stealth more.\nSince my list was exhausted, I bought the Probe.  :-)\n\nThe car design is different than earlier years, so it's too early to see its\nreliability so far.  For what it's worth, my comments:\n\nMy dislikes:\nShutting door with windows up from inside rarely makes good wind seal.\nHeadlights have \"stuck\" up a few times (weather?)\nair conditioning broke ~4000 miles (pressure cycling switch)\ncondensation around rear washer fluid container doesn't drain completely.\ncrammed engine; little hope for do-it-yourselfers (typical)\nparts somewhat more expensive than normal Ford parts\nunderside plastic doesn't like sharp driveways and speedbumps (typical).\nassembly gripes: tape on radiator, screw fell out of dash, seat seams not \nstitched properly.  Hopefully just a fluke.\nFord only gives 1 key with the car.  C'mon Ford, spend an extra few pennies!\nRear hatch has no padding on corners when up.  I'm waiting for the day when\nI bash my head on the corner.\nhorn buttons behind air bag in spokes and not in center (personal preference)\nTires fling dirt/mud onto side of car \n\nMy Likes:\nengine (design/valves/sounds/smoothness/power/mileage/torque) -- definitely #1\nhandling (very good for FWD; understeer only at limits)\ntransmission (the 5 speed is a must)\nusable instrumentation (lovely readable analog everywhere)\nVery little torque steer at full power (much better than the '90 SHO I drive)\nstability at 100+mph (high gearing though)\nlow cowl (good visibility in front)\nHeated outside mirrors (nice in fog, never tested in freezing weather)\nABS/Air bag (see above)\nrear seats fold down (I have few rear seat passengers so a trunk not important)\nNo shake/rattle noises when going over bumps/potholes (still!)\nTires: 225/55VR16 Goodyear Eagles (70% left; hoping for 30K :-)\n\nAs you can see, I'm primarily interested in the engine.  While it doesn't\nhave the uummmph of a big-liter car or the turbo rush, the big selling\npoint for me was the all-aluminum 24 value 2.5 liter engine.  \n\nThe overall car is a good buy for the money.  That market segment hasn't changed\nmuch since July (Prelude VTEC, Honda Del Sol??).  I drive it to and from work\neach day on relatively smooth roads, and most noticable thing is that the\nProbe's suspension doesn't like potholes.  When you test drive one, find a \npotholed road somewhere around town and see if the jarring you get is tolerable.\nIf you have 3+ passengers, by all means bring them along too.  They'll find\nthat they have no room in the back and you'll find that the car rides\ndifferently (if that's \"better\" is up to you).  Also, there's a lot of glass\naround you which I wasn't expecting; the temperature inside the car gets pretty\nhot in the summer.  My back seat passengers (now very few) complain about\nthe lack of ventilation; you may want to consider that when combined with\nthe heat.  I've heard that the exhaust system has trouble, but mine works fine.\nLeather and the keyless entry system weren't available when I got the car so\nI can't comment on them (I got the car before it was officially announced).  \nI prefer cloth to leather anyway.  \n\nI wouldn't want this car in the snow:  The suspension is too rough for the\ninevitable surprise potholes, tires aren't meant for snow, and the seats assume\nthat you're not wearing lots of thick clothing.  Rain is much better:  water \ngenerally beads off the windshield at freeway speed, the windshield wiper\ncontrols are easy and understandable, and I barely hydroplaned once with the\nEagles (and I was really trying).  \nThere is also a definite lack of cup holder/small storage places.  The GT\nhas map holders below the speakers in the door, but they're rigid plastic\nthat could fit two cassettes or CD's max.  The center console/storage bin/arm\nrest has *1* cup holder and the back of the front seats have a cloth \"pouch\"\nbut that's it.  No change holders.  Quite a let-down from the SHO.\nAnd the Probe is definitely not a people-mover car or an econo-box car!\n\nLastly, don't store wet car covers in the back.  The foam will soak the \nwater up and the result will *not* smell pleasant :-(.\n\nNathan\nnathan@sco.com\n\n>\n>^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^\n>|Jeremy Mereness                 | Support     | Ye Olde Disclaimer:    |\n>|zonker+@cmu.edu (internet)      |    Free     |  The above represent my|\n>| FAST Project, CMU-GSIA         |     Software|   opinions, alone.     |\n>|B.S.

A metal pad is pressed against\nthe rotor using the torque wrench until the rotor stopped by friction. \nThe torque that is needed to stop rotor is read from the torque wrench.\n\nBefore MILITECH was added, the rotor was stopped with about 60 lb-ft\nof torque (You pick the brand of oil, no difference). Once MILITECH was \nadded to the oil, the rotor could not be stopped even with 120+ lb-ft of\ntorque. \n\nHere is the good part: even after the salesman emptied the oil sink, \nyou still could not stopped the rotor with the thin film remained  on it.\n\nThey say you need only add 2oz per quart of oil every 15k miles.

New York prohibits their use in\n    large trucks.  In Canada, they are illegal in Manitoba, Ontario,\n    Quebec, Newfoundland and PEI (Prince Edward Island).  They\n    are apparently are illegal through most, if not all, of Europe.\n    Legislation which would make them illegal is pending in many other\n    jurisdictions; chances of such legislation passing varies a great deal.\n\nQ:  Where are Radar Detector Detectors used?  Do they really work?\n\nA:  Usage is spreading rapidly; initially they were used only in Canada,\n    but now they are appearing in New York and Virginia.  It is unsafe\n    to assume that they are not in use in Connecticut and D.C.\n    They work by detecting a certain frequency radiated by many currently\n    available super Het radar detectors; some brands of detector radiate\n    more strongly than others, and are thus more likely to be spotted.\n    New radar detectors are becoming available which may not be detected\n    by the current generation of detector detectors.  Note that a\n    detector may only be spotted by one of these devices if it is turned\n    on.\n\nQ:  What is VASCAR?  Is it some kind of Radar?\n\nA:  VASCAR is nothing more than a fancy stopwatch and time-speed-distance\n    computer.  It depends on the operator pressing buttons as the target\n    vehicle passes landmarks.  No radar signals are emitted by a VASCAR\n    system.\n\nQ:  What is Ka band radar?  Where is it used?  Should a radar detector be\n    able to handle it? \n\nA:  Ka band has recently been made available by the FCC for use in the US\n    in so-called photo-radar installations.  In these installations, a\n    low-powered beam is aimed across the road at a 45 degree angle to the\n    direction of traffic, and a picture is taken of vehicles which the\n    radar unit determines to have been in violation of the speed limit.\n    Tickets are mailed to the owner of the vehicle.  Because of the low\n    power and the 45 degree angle, many people believe that a radar\n    detector cannot give reasonable warning of a Ka band radar unit,\n    although some manufacturers of radar detectors have added such\n    capability anyway.  The number of locales where photo-radar is in use\n    is limited, and some question the legality of such units.  Best advice:\n    learn what photo radar units look like, and keep track of where they\n    are used (or else, don't speed.)\n\nQ:  Do radar jammers work?  Are they legal?\n\nA:  Quick answer:  No, and Not in the USA.\n    Detailed answer:  Cheap radar jammers do not work well at all.\n    Jammers that work are expensive and usually the property of the\n    military.  Jammers are a major violation of the regulations of the\n    Federal Communications Commission of the USA.\n\nDriving technique and Vehicle Dynamics Questions:\n\nQ:  What are understeer and oversteer?\n\nA:  Understeer and oversteer are terms describing the behaviour of a\n    car while cornering near the `limit' (limit of adhesion, that is.)\n    Most drivers do not normally drive hard enough for these terms to\n    be descriptive of the situations they encounter.  Simply put, they\n    tell whether the car wants to go straight in a corner (steer `less',\n    or `understeer') or it wants to turn more in a corner (`oversteer'.)\n    Understeer is commonly designed into most production cars so that\n    untrained drivers, inadvertantly traveling too fast, won't get into\n    trouble.  Understeer may also be induced by using too much throttle\n    in a corner.  Oversteer is designed into some more performance\n    oriented cars; it may be induced by lifting on the throttle (Trailing\n    throttle oversteer, or TTO).  In extreme cases, lifting on the throttle\n    may induce so much oversteer that the car reacts by fishtailing or\n    spinning.\n\n    Some technical details:  in a corner at speed, the tires on the car\n    will develop what are called `slip angles'; the slip angle is the\n    angular difference between the direction that the car is traveling\n    and the direction that the steering wheel is directing the car to\n    travel.  In understeer, the front wheels have a greater slip angle\n    than the rear wheels.  In oversteer, the rear wheels have a greater\n    slip angle than the front wheels.\n\nQ: What is a rev-matched downshift?\n\nA: When downshifting, the engine must be rotating faster in the lower gear\n   than it was in the higher gear.  However, during a downshift, normally\n   you declutch and lift your foot from the throttle, so the revs drop\n   rather than increase.  In rev-matched downshift, you blip the throttle\n   before re-engaging the clutch so that the engine will already be up to\n   the new speed.  This results in a much smoother and faster downshift.\n\nQ: What does heel-and-toe mean?\n\nA: Heel-and-toe is a technique used to do a rev-matched downshift while\n   braking.  This is normally challenging, because you need the right foot\n   for both the brake and throttle.  It is called heel-and-toe because you\n   use one end of the foot on the brake, and the other on the throttle to\n   match revs for the downshift.  In many modern cars this is a misnomer;\n   often you must use the ball of the foot on the brake and the right side\n   on the throttle.\n\n   Note that some race car drivers will skip the clutch, and just use the\n   left foot on the brake and the right foot on the throttle, accomplishing\n   the same thing.\n\nQ: What is double-clutch downshifting?\n\nA: While your right foot is doing the above, your left foot can do one of\n   three things:  nothing, declutch once, or declutch twice.  The reason for\n   declutching twice is to match the speeds of the two shafts in the\n   transmission to the speed of the engine.  This is usually coupled with\n   rev-matching, so that while the engine is in neutral and the clutch\n   engaged, the throttle is blipped and both shafts of the transmission\n   speed up.\n\n   The procedure is as follows:\n   (0) declutch\n   (1) move gearshift lever to neutral\n   (2) engage clutch\n   (3) match revs\n   (4) declutch\n   (5) move gearshift lever to next lower gear\n   (6) engage clutch\n\n   This sounds like a lot of work, but with practice it becomes natural.\n   The problem that double-clutching solves is normally the function of the\n   synchronizers within the gearbox.  In transmissions without synchros or\n   with very worn synchros, double-clutching makes it much easier to shift.\n   Basically, if you double-clutch well, you are not using the synchros at\n   all.  This is generally unnecessary on street cars with synchros in good\n   condition.\n\nQ: What do the numbers for acceleration from 0-60, 1/4 mile, skidpad, and\n   slalom times in the Auto Magazines really mean?  May they be compared?\n\nA: In short, 1) not as much as the magazines want you to believe, and\n   2) almost never.\n\n   In more detail:  the acceleration numbers (0-60mph and 1/4 mile times\n   in the US) may be vaguely compared as long as they all come from the\n   same source.  Testing procedures vary so much from magazine to magazine\n   that comparing a Road & Track number to a Car & Driver number is quite\n   pointless.  Keep in mind, too, that the same variation applies from\n   driver to driver on the street; the driver is a major (often *the*\n   major) part of the equation.\n\n   Skidpads vary, and even if they didn't, skidpad figures are really\n   only tests of the stickiness of the stock tires; they change radically\n   when tire compounds change.  DO NOT make any assumptions about the\n   comparative handling of, say, two sports sedans based on skidpad numbers.\n   This is not to suggest that skidpads are without value, however. Skidpads\n   are an excellent educational tool at driving schools.  They are simply\n   of limited value in the comparison of anything except tires.\n\n   Slalom times are slightly more useful; they test some small parts of the\n   automobile's transient response.  However, they are also heavily influenced\n   by the stock rubber on the car, and they do not test many corners of the\n   car's envelope.  They DO NOT tell you all you need to know before making\n   a buying decision.  For example, they don't tell you what the rear end\n   of the car will do on a road which suddenly goes off-camber.  When a car\n   has an adjustable suspension, these tests are usually done in the `sport'\n   setting, which may be quite unsuitable for daily driving.  The list of\n   caveats could go on for page after page.\n\nQ: My buddy claims that wide tires don't make any difference, according\n   to his freshman physics textbook, and that you can't ever accelerate\n   or corner at more than 1.0G.  Does he know what he's talking about?\n\nA: 1) in short:  he hasn't got a clue.\n\n   2) in more detail: the equations for friction used in freshman physics\n   textbooks presume that the surfaces are smooth,  dry and non-deformable,\n   none of which properly apply to tire traction except in the case of a\n   stone cold tire on dry pavement which is far below its proper operating\n   temperature.\n\n   Pavement is _never_ smooth; it is always irregular to a greater or lesser\n   extent.  Tires, which are not really dry and solid (as rubber is a\n   substance which in its natural form is liquid, and which has only been\n   coerced into a semblance of solidity by chemical magic), deform to match\n   the surface of the pavement which a vehicle is traveling over.  In a tire\n   at operating temperature, grip is actually generated by shear stresses\n   inside the deformed rubber, and not by anything even remotely resembling\n   friction in the freshman physics sense of the term.  The colder a tire\n   is relative to its operating temperature, the closer its behaviour will\n   be to the traditional concept of friction; if much hotter than the its\n   proper operating temperature, the more likely the possibility of some\n   part of the tire actually ``reverting'' to liquid, which is mostly like\n   to happen deep in the tread, causing characteristic blisters and chunking.\n   (This latter, though, is almost completely unlikely to happen in normal\n   street driving, so unless you're a competition driver or do a lot of\n   high speed track driving, don't worry about it.)\n\n   Because tire traction is completely out of the domain of simple friction,\n   it does not obey the freshman physics equation at all; thus dragsters\n   accelerate at more than 1.0G and race cars corner and brake at more than\n   1.0G.  Because simple friction does not apply, it is actually possible\n   for different sized contact patches to generate differing amounts of\n   grip.  An actual analysis of tire behavior would require techniques\n   such as Finite Element Analysis, due to the complexity of the mechanism.\n\nMisc. Questions:\n\nQ:  What does <name or acronym> stand for?\n\nA:  Here is a list of some of the names which are commonly asked\n    about; be careful in soliciting the meanings of other names\n    as misinformation abounds on the net.  In particular, NEVER\n    ask in rec.humor if you want a useful result.\n\n    Saab:   Svenska Aeroplan A. B.,\n              or The Swedish Airplane Corporation\n\n    Alfa:   Societa Anonima Lombarda Fabbrica Automobili,\n              or The Lombardy Automobile Manufacturing Company\n\n    Fiat:   Fabbrica Italiana di Automobili Torino,\n              or The Italian Automobile Manufacturers of Turin\n\n    BMW:    Bayerische Motoren Werke,\n              or Bavarian Motor Works\n\n    MG:     Morris Garage\n\n\nQ:  Does VW own Porsche?\n\nA:  No.  Porsche is a publicly held company, controlled by the Porsche and\n    Piech families.  Porsche has extensive business dealings with VW/Audi,\n    which causes some confusion.  Since currently Porsche is in some\n    financial difficulty, there is a possibility that Mercedes or VW may\n    be interested in purchasing the company in the near future, but this\n    is only speculation at this time.\n-- \nrichard welty        518-393-7228       welty@cabot.balltown.cma.com\n``Nothing good has ever been reported about the full rotation of\n  a race car about either its pitch or roll axis''  -- Carroll Smith\n</td><td>7</td><td>rec.autos</td><td>Archive-name: rec-autos/part4</td><td>[this article is one of a pair of articles containing commonly\nasked automotive questions; the other article contains questions\nof general consumer interest, and is broken out to facilitate\ncrossposting to misc.consumers -- rpw]</td><td>229</td></tr><tr><td>From: mcostell@oasys.dt.navy.mil (Malcolm G.

It was more expensive (when new) than the gasoline\nengine vehicle was.  The only problem with diesel engines is that \nwhen they need to be rebuilt, they are expensive.  In a gas 350\nengine, you will pay about $1000 for a rebuild.  Diesel 6.2L is about\n$2000.  But then again, the diesel engine lasts about twice as long\nand gets about 50% better mileage.  A carburator for a gasoline engine\ncosts about $100 to rebuild (or less).  A rebuild of the fuel injection\npump on a diesel will cost about $500 (or more).  But then again,\nyou never need a tune-up.\n\nIf you're looking at a rebuilt 6.2L, I'd say you got a great deal.\nCheck to see if the fuel injection pump was rebuilt also.\n\nGood luck.\n</td><td>7</td><td>rec.autos</td><td>In article <91321@hydra.gatech.EDU> jkg@jmp.com writes:\n>Apologies if this is a FAQ (is there a FAQ posting for this group?

Most of the other\nmodels are in the same class, but aren't the first cars you would think of.\nI threw in the Escort/Tracer because it has a good amount of Japanese\ntechnology and has similar reliability stats.  I didn't include domestic small\ncars such as the Cavalier, Sunbird, Shadow, Sundance, Tempo, and Topaz, since I\nthink Saturn is going after cars that have at least some degree of Japanese\nroots.\n\nThe SC1/SC2 was meant to compete against the following cars:\n\nToyota Paseo\nHonda Civic Si/Civic Coupes/del Sol Si\nNissan NX1600/NX2000\nMazda MX-3\nIsuzu Impulse\nGeo Storm\nFord Escort GT\n\n\nIf you look at the prices of these cars, they're more expensive than they're\n4-door counterparts.  The is good reason for this.  It is a more upscale and\ntrend-driven market.  Even though many of these models are based on sedan\nplatforms, their interior, etc. is good enough to warrant slightly higher\nprices.  Here are some of the platform derivations I can think of:\n\nTercel -> Paseo\nSentra -> NX1600/NX2000\nCivic -> del Sol\n323 -> MX-3 (not sure on this one)\nStylus -> Impulse/Storm\n\nTo illustrate, a Tercel starts at around $8000, while the Paseo starts at\naround $11,000.  Even a 4-door Tercel will cost less than a 2-door Paseo.  Now,\nyou might be saying that the Tercel doesn't offer the power that some 4-doors\noffer.  What I mean is that there is no 4-dr Tercel with a comparable\npowerplant as its sport coupe derivative.  Let's take another example: the\nIsuzu Stylus XS and Impulse XS/Storm GSi.  Both have the same powerplants (a\n1.6L 140hp engine), but the smaller 2-dr coupes are generally more expensive.\nAgain, this is because the two-door sport coupe market is a more\nfashion-oriented and trend-setting segment.  People are willing to pay more\nmoney for this type of car.  \n\n\nIn short, even though the SC1/SC2 may be smaller, hence \"less\" car, it's market\norientation dictates a slightly higher price than its mechanically equivalent\nsedan (SL1/SL2) version.\n\nI hope this clears things up a bit......\n\n\nMihir Shah\n\t \n</td><td>7</td><td>rec.autos</td><td>In article <C50p1M.21o@noose.ecn.purdue.edu> rjwade@rainbow.ecn.purdue.edu (Robert J.

It seems to me that Saturn salesdroids, who don't \nmake a commision, whereas their counterparts at other dealerships generally\ndo, make more $$ per hour or whatever.  This means that Saturn doesn't give up\nthe profit to their employees through commision, which IS taken out of per-\ncar profits.  They just pass it along to less pressureing salesmen/women.\n\n>Isn't that saving money?\n\n\tMaybe.  Maybe not.  Depends on accounting practices.

This article\nwill provide the essential information for doing so on standard\nUnix systems.  A shell script and examples of alias file setups\nare included which presently run on a Sparc 2 here at balltown.cma.com\nfor a number of mailing lists.  Note that if you do set up an automotive\nmailing list, please let me know of the -request address so that I can\nlist it in the montly rec.autos posting.  Also inform the keeper of the\nUsenet list-of-lists (check news.answers for this monthly posting.)\n\nFirst of all, to get anywhere, you need to either 1) be a sysadmin,\nor 2) have some measure of assistance from your sysadmin.  It is also\nimportant that you have reasonably good network connectivity; if it seems\nlike you get everything several days after anyone else, or that you\nhave trouble getting email through, then your network connectivity is\nprobably not good enough.\n\nListserv:\n\nThere is a handy automated mailing list package named listserv, which\nis available from several ftp servers on the network.  Details of\nthe installation and operation of listserv are beyond the scope of this\narticle, but anyone who is considering running a large mailing list should\nprobably  look at listserv carefully.\n\nThe Alias file:\n\nOn a typical unix system; there is a file named /usr/lib/aliases on\nwhichever file server is your mail host; it contains lines such as:\n\nfoo:   bar, baz, bletch\n\n\nwhich means that any email sent the name `foo' on that host is\nredistributed to users bar, baz, and bletch.  thus, the simplest\npossible email list is \n\nmy-favorite-car:  member1, member2, member3, my-address\nmy-favorite-car-request: my-address\n\nthis has a couple of problems; the most noticeable one being that\nyou have to be superuser to edit the alias file.  however, you can\ndo the following, with the connivance of your sysadmin:\n\nmy-favorite-car: :include:/home/mydir/misc/autos/my-favorite-car-list\nmy-favorite-car-request: my-address\n\nWhere the file specified is a list of comma and newline separated\naddresses.  This file can be in the list admin's home directory,\nowned by the list admin.\n\nBounced Mail:\n\nthis still has a problem; bounced mail usually gets distributed to all the\nmembers of the list, which is generally considered somewhat irritating.\nTherefore, the way that the driving school mailing list is set up\nis instructive (Thanks to harpal chohan of the bmw list for this setup,\nby the way.  I'm not sure where he got it from.)\n\n\nschool-request:   welty\nschool-rebroadcast:  :include:/home/newwelty/misc/autos/school/list\nschool: \"|/usr/local/adm/bin/explscript school\"\nowner-school: school-request\nowner-school-out: school-request\n\n\nhere's what is going on here:\n\nthe owner- and -request addresses are intended as traps for bounced mail\ncoming from the network.  the -request address also serves as the point\nof contact for administrative duties.\n\nschool is what people send mail to; instead of pointing at addresses,\nit points at a shell script which rewrites headers before resending\nthe email.  school-broadcast (of which nobody except me knows the name;\nthe name has been changed here to protect my own sanity) points at the\nactual list members.\n\nthe shell script i use is as follows:\n\n-----------------\n#!/bin/sh\ncd /tmp\nsed -e '/^Reply-To:/d' -e '/^Sender:/d' -e '/^From /d' | \\\n        (echo Reply-To: ${1}@balltown.cma.com; \\\n         echo Errors-To: ${1}-request@balltown.cma.com; \\\n         echo Sender: ${1}-request@balltown.cma.com; \\\n         cat -) | \\\n        /usr/lib/sendmail -om -f ${1}-request@balltown.cma.com \\\n                -F \"The ${1} Mailing List\" ${1}-rebroadcast\nexit 0\n-------------------\n\nnote that this script does not know the name of the list; the name\nis passed in from outside, so that the script may be used for multiple\nlists (i run several out of this site.)\nthe script excises Reply-To:, Sender:, and From lines from the incoming\nmessage, substitutes for Sender: and Reply-To:, and adds Errors-to:\n99.9% of all email bounce messages end up being sent to the -request\nor owner- addresses if this header rewrite is done.\n\nFor digested lists, there is some digestification software around.\nHopefully I'll be able to provide more information in a future version\nof this posting.\n\nrichard welty (welty@balltown.cma.com)\n-- \nrichard welty        518-393-7228       welty@cabot.balltown.cma.com\n``Nothing good has ever been reported about the full rotation of\n  a race car about either its pitch or roll axis''  -- Carroll Smith\n</td><td>7</td><td>rec.autos</td><td>Archive-Name: rec-autos/part6</td><td>[New article as of 4 February 1993 -- rpw]</td><td>301</td></tr><tr><td>From: jimiii@nimbus.com (Jim Warford)\nSubject: Re: electronic odometers (was: Used BMW Question ..... ???)\nReply-To: jimiii@nimbus.com (Jim Warford)\nOrganization: Nimbus Technology, Santa Clara, CA USA\nLines: 32\n\nIn article <13269@news.duke.edu> klg@mookie.mc.duke.edu (Kim Greer) writes:\n>\n>  I was wondering if anyone can shed any light on just how it is that these\n>electronic odometers remember the total elapsed mileage?

Jacking up the frame some more\n(had to put the spare tire on the garage floor and put a wooden \nplatform on top of that to get the 'floor jack' high enough to\nraise the frame ... I't one TALLL truck...) lifted the spring\nfree of the axel.  Taking out the block gave me enough room to\nundo the pin holding the spring pack together.\n\nThe spring pack was held together with a nut on top and a round head\non the other end....  No wrench head...  Vice Grips worked fine...\nI soaked the nut with WD40 and it came right off.\n\nFlipped the bottom spring and then...\n\n>>Is this a nightmare waiting to happen, or an easy, though physically\n>>demanding, thing to do?\n>\n>Well, it's easier than doing a decent trigger job on a 1911A1 :-)\n>(OK, well, maybe it's not _that_ easy, but it's not terribly\n>difficult.)\n\nI donno ... I'm a little more sore today than after working on a\n1911A1 ...\n\nA 1.5 foot pipe cheater was a real help.  Torque spec for the U bolt\nnuts is 150 to 200 ft-lbs (!).   A 1911-A1 doesn't have that kind of\ntorque spec ...\n\nIt was a 'challenge' to get the 'pack bolt' back in the spring pack.  \nSqueeze pack with two hands, hold bolt with third, put nut on\nwith fourth while picking up wrench and vice grips with fifth\nand sixth hands ...  I used some string to tie the pack together\nwhile holding the pin in for alignment... then I could let go\nto get the {nut, wrench, Vice Grips...}.\n\nGetting the pin back lined up with the lift block was a challenge too...\nuntil I discovered that the axel had 1) Tilted and/or 2) rolled forward.\n\nOne the drivers side, a bottle jack under the front of the differential\ntilted it back in line enough for the pin head to drop into the right\nhole.  On the passenger side, I had to wrestle the wheel into rolling\nforward about 1/2 inch to get things to line up.  Spent more than an\nhour working on getting the pin head into the hole in the lift block\nwith levers and ropes and impliments of distruction before I took a \nbreak and thought about WHY it wasn't lined up anymore (since it HAD\nbeen lined up before, and *I* didn't move it, something ELSE must \nhave ... hmmm, axle no longer constrained not to move ... hmmm, move \nit back... hmmm...).\n\nAfter that, it was all much easier to 'close up'.\n\nBTW, the ride is now softer, but not quite as soft as I was hoping for.\nAt least it now sits level..\n\n-- \n\nE.

The 60 is the `aspect ratio'; it indicates the height of the\n    sidewall of the tire relative to the overall width.  Our example tire\n    has a sidewall height of 0.60 * 195 ~= 117 mm.  The 14 is the wheel\n    diameter in inches; there are also some special tires called `TRX'\n    tires which have three digit metric wheel diameter designations, like\n    390, which is in millimeters.  The R means Radial, and the H is a speed\n    rating indicating the highest speed at which the tire, when properly\n    inflated and carrying an appropriate load, may safely operate.  Common\n    speed ratings are S (112MPH), T (118MPH), H (130MPH), and V (up to\n    150MPH.)\n\n    Recent changes to the method for specifying tire sizes move the speed\n    rating to a different part of the designation; you may therefore find\n    designations like 195/60R14 85H; the 85 indicates the per-tire load\n    associated with the speed rating -- exceeding this load in continuous\n    operation at the rated speed is dangerous practice.  What follows is\n    a table showing a number of `load indices' and corresponding maximum\n    per-tire loads:\n\n    Load Index       50   51   88   89   112   113   145   149   157\n    Max Load (Kg)   190  195  560  580  1120  1150  2900  3250  4125\n\n    Note that the usual mass vs. weight confusion occurs in this table.\n\n    In some cases, the letters P or LT may be found in front of a tire\n    size; the LT designation indicates Light Truck, and the P designation\n    indicates Passenger car.  If no letter is given, then the application\n    of the tire is Passenger car usage.  As far as I know, these letters\n    only appear in the US market.  The LT designation is prinicipally of\n    interest to owners of light trucks and other utility vehicles.  For\n    the owner of a passenger vehicle, there is no meaningful difference\n    between a tire with a P designation and one with no designation at\n    all.\n\n    If the aspect ratio is omitted, it is probably 80, but may be 78.\n\n    Tires with an MS (mud/snow) designation may have their speed rating\n    reduced by 20 km/h (about 12mph.)\n\n    There is an additional set of ratings on tires for temperature,\n    traction, and treadwear.  Temperature and Traction are graded\n    A, B, and C (with A the best and C the worst); treadwear is\n    a numeric rating.  These values are of limited value, as they\n    are assigned somewhat arbitrarily by tire manufacturers and are\n    thus not useful in comparing different brands of tires.\n\nQ:  My car has tires with a funny size designation:  185/65HR390; can i put\n    normal tires on the car?\n\nA:  Your tires are called TRX tires; they were devised by Michelin.\n    Because of a somewhat different bead design, they are incompatible\n    with normal tires; Michelin used a different diameter wheel for them\n    so that they could not be mounted on the wrong type wheel (and so that\n    more conventional tires could not be mounted on TRX type wheels.)\n    You will need to aquire different wheels to put a normal tire on your\n    car; it is barely possible to fit normal tires on TRX wheels, and horribly\n    dangerous to do so (the tires may simply peel off the rims in a corner,\n    or possibly blow out at high speed.)  TRX type tires are becoming hard\n    to find; in addition to Michelin, Avon makes suitable tires.  Goodyear\n    has apparently discontinued their line of TRX tires.\n\nQ:  Can I rotate radials from side to side, or rotate them only on one side\n    of my car?\n\nA:  Car and tire manufacturers have differing views on this subject; many\n    say that swapping radials between the left and right hand sides of a\n    car is now ok (this group includes Michelin and Goodyear); others\n    (for example, Pirelli and Nokia) will void warranties if such swapping\n    is done.  The best advice is to read your tire manual carefully before\n    rotating your tires, and stick to the manufacturer's recommendations.\n\nQ:  How many snow tires should I buy, and if I buy 2, which end of the\n    car should I put them on?\n\nA:  In short, 4, and both ends.  To explain, many drivers in areas that don't\n    get excessive snow or who don't drive agressively (or at all) in snow\n    conditions get away with only two snows on the drive wheels, but there\n    are circumstances where this can be dangerous practice.  With a rear\n    wheel drive car, you can choose between being able to start the car\n    going (a function of the rear axle) or stopping and turning the car\n    (a function of the front axle.)  In a front wheel drive car, you start,\n    stop, and turn with the front end.  The primary risk of putting the\n    snow tires on the front only is that if you have to put on the brakes\n    while going downhill, you run a serious risk of going downhill backwards.\n\nRadar Detectors and Speed Limits:\n\nQ:  Why aren't there any comments on Radar Detectors and Speed Limits\n    in this Q&A posting?\n\nA:  Because questions about detectors and speed limits crossposted between\n    misc.consumers and rec.autos.* always start long, tedious, and pointless\n    flame wars.  If you want to talk about either of these topics, please\n    subscribe to rec.autos or alt.flame and keep it there.\n\nSafety Equipment:\n\nQ:  Do airbags really work?\n\nA:  Preliminary statistics suggest the following:  Airbags work much\n    better than no belts; good 3 point belts alone work much better than\n    Airbags alone, and AirBags + 3 point belts work slightly better than\n    3 point belts alone.  The con to airbags is that some designs tend\n    to burn the driver's hands when venting the byproducts of the\n    explosion that occurs inside the bag, and that some designs (but\n    not all) may knock the driver's hands from the wheel, making retention\n    of control of the vehicle after the bag deflates more difficult.\n\nBrake Questions:\n\nQ:  Do I always need to get the rotors on my disk brakes turned?  Midas\n    always wants to do this.\n\nA:  No.  There are specific conditions that mandate turning or replacing\n    rotors; some shops try and make a little extra money by replacing rotors\n    more often than is strictly necessary.  if the rotors are not warped\n    warped, and only lightly grooved, then there is no need to replace or\n    to turn them.  Note also that some rotors (the rotors on many Hondas\n    are a good example) are so narrow to begin with that it is not practical\n    to turn them; they must be replaced when they become too thin, warped,\n    or badly grooved.\n\nQ:  They tell me I should downshift when braking to slow my car down.  Is\n    this really a good idea?\n\nA:  It used to be a very good idea, back in the days of mediocre, fade\n    prone drum brakes.  In modern disc brake equipped cars, use of\n    downshifting to slow the car is not really necessary, except in cases\n    of long, steep downhill runs.  Otherwise, modern disc brakes are more\n    than adequate to stop a passenger car in all circumstances, and they\n    are much cheaper to repair than clutch linings.\n\n    On the other hand, many standard driver's license tests in the USA\n    still specify that the driver being tested downshift under braking; I\n    suggest that before taking a US driver's test, you either 1) learn to\n    do this smoothly (which takes some time and practice) or 2) borrow a\n    car with an automatic to take the test.\n\nQ:  How often should I replace my brake fluid?\n\nA:  Probably more often than you do.  Traditional brake fluids tend to\n    absorb water; this water can corrode internal parts of the brake\n    system and also lower the boiling point of the fluid.  DOT-3 type\n    are older fluids; DOT-4 and DOT-5 are newer specifications.  The\n    principal differences are in wet and dry boiling points; the dry\n    boiling point is important in fresh brake fluid, but the wet boiling\n    point is important in older brake fluid.  DOT-3 fluids have the lowest\n    wet and dry boiling point _requirements_; DOT-4 fluids have better\n    boiling point requirements; and DOT-5 fluids have the best boiling\n    point requirements (but DOT-5 fluids are not clearly superior; see\n    the next Q&A for more details.)  While the requirements imply that\n    DOT-4 fluids are better than DOT-3 fluids, there may be specific\n    cases where a DOT-3 fluid is preferable, but these are mostly\n    competition applications.  Otherwise, DOT-4 type fluids offer _much_\n    improved brake pedal feel.  Replacement once a year is recommended for\n    DOT-4 fluids, although agressive drivers may profit by changing out\n    fluid more frequently, or at least bleeding a modest amount of fluid\n    out of the brake calipers fairly regularly.\n\nQ:  What about DOT-5 brake fluids?\n\nA:  This breaks down in to two parts.  The DOT-5 specification looks\n    excellent for performance, but the first DOT-5 fluids were Silicone\n    based.  Silicone fluids are a tricky proposition.  Unlike DOT-3 and\n    DOT-4 fluids, they do not absorb water at all.  While this may sound\n    like a feature, the problem is that any water present pools up in\n    such systems, interfering with braking performance and corroding any\n    metals at the spot where the pooling is occuring.  The water will tend\n    to migrate downwards in the braking system to the brake calipers, where\n    most of the corrosion occurs.\n\n    Because of this phenomenon, it is essential when converting to\n    Silicone to empty the entire brake system and flush it throughly\n    beforehand; some even recommend replacing all rubber parts in the\n    brake system when converting to Silicone fluids.\n\n    Two other issues that come up with silicone fluids:  1) they are\n    difficult to pour cleanly (that is, without air bubbles), which\n    interferes with getting a good brake pedal feel, and 2) while they\n    generally have much higher boiling points than DOT-4 fluids, they\n    do have high temperature failure modes which are indistinguishable\n    in effect from boiling DOT-4 fluids.  SIlicone fluids may make sense\n    in some street car applications, but they are certainly not\n    recommended for high performance driving applications, and the\n    economics are questionable for street use.\n\n    I have recently become aware of new fluids that meet the DOT-5 standard\n    that do not contain Silicones; these fluids appear to be reasonably\n    compatible with the older DOT-3 and DOT-4 fluids, but I have little\n    information at this time.\n\nQ:  ABS is available on some of the cars I'm looking at, but it costs\n    more.  Is it worth it?\n\nA:  This does not have a cut and dried answer; therefore, this answer will\n    be quite long in order to cover the pros and cons.  The short answer\n    is that ABS costs more, both initially, and to maintain, will generally\n    work better for the `average driver' (that is to say, a driver who does\n    not have extensive experience in high performance driving techniques),\n    and may require the `unlearning' of some obsolete braking techniques\n    like pump braking which should be unlearned in any case.\n\n    Now for the long answer.  ABS works by monitering the wheels of the\n    car, looking for signs of locked brakes.  It may or may not be able\n    be able to distinguish between the different wheels (there are several\n    systems on the market.)  It cannot detect impending lockup (which is\n    what you would really want in an ideal world), but only the existence\n    of lockup.  The sensors used vary; some of the less well designed\n    sensors are sensitive to tire size, and to brake pad material, and\n    may cease to function properly if the owner deviates from original\n    equipment or OE-equivalent components.\n\n    When the sensors detect lockup, the ABS system responds by unlocking\n    the brakes (either individually, or all at once, depending on the\n    system.)  If the driver keeps their foot firmly planted, the ABS\n    will end up cycling between the locked and unlocked states (if a\n    sensor existed that could detect _impending lockup_, then we could\n    sit right at that point, which is where maximum braking effect is\n    achieved.)  This pulsing can often be felt in the brake pedal, as\n    the system cycles.  The percentage of the time that the brakes are\n    truly engaged is called the `duty cycle'; typically in an ABS system\n    this is about 40%  On dry pavement, a trained driver can beat this\n    duty cycle quite reliably using a technique called threshold braking;\n    on wet pavement, braking is so chancy that ABS will outperform\n    threshold braking nearly every time.  Unfortunately, on mud and on\n    snow, often maximum braking effect can be acheived with the brakes\n    locked; only Audi, of the manufacturers producing ABS-equipped cars,\n    has seen fit to provide a disable switch for the ABS system for this\n    eventuality.\n\n    A particularly important feature of ABS is that it preserves\n    steering control.  This is the case simply because, if you are\n    braking near the limit and turn the wheel, the ABS will release\n    the brakes if it sees steering-triggered lockup, and back off\n    on the percentage of the time that the brakes are applied.\n    Braking distances will lengthen accordingly.\n\n    An important caution:  ABS cannot exceed the maximum theoretical\n    braking force in any given situation; if you start sliding on\n    glare ice, don't expect an ABS system to help you out very much.\n    The coefficient of friction is not changed by the presence of an\n    ABS system in your car.\n\n    As far as maintenence goes, in addition to the potential\n    restrictions I've listed above, you have to worry about the\n    following:  1) parts costs are much higher; the OE master cylinder\n    for my obscure european sedan lists for $185, but the OE master\n    cylinder for the ABS-equipped version of the same car lists for\n    over $1000.  Most manufacturers explicitly forbid use of DOT-5\n    (silicone) brake fluids in ABS-equipped vehicles.  Because of\n    the potential cost of replacement of corroded brake system\n    components, regular (I suggest annual) replacement of brake fluid\n    becomes very important.\n\nQ:  What about this threshold braking business?\n\nA:  [normally, I'd not put this in the consumers Q&A, but recent\n    publicity about a number of accidents involving police drivers\n    in ABS-equipped Chevy Caprices suggests that this section is\n    needed here -- rpw]\n\n    Threshold braking is a technique practiced by all serious high\n    performance drivers; if made a habit, it replaces the `stab\n    the pedal and lock 'em up' panic habit entirely, and is much\n    to be prefered.  Basically, the premise is that tires generate\n    maximum braking force when they have just started to slide, but\n    just before the wheels lock up entirely.  Drivers who threshold\n    brake learn to feel what this `threshold' feels like, and learn\n    to search for it and hit it on the application of the brake\n    pedal.  In many cars, you can feel that you are near the\n    threshold when the pedal starts to firm up as you depress it.\n    In any case, if you can't hear the tires whine just a bit, you're\n    not very near the threshold.\n\n    In a car with ABS, often there is a twinge in the pedal just\n    before the system starts cycling; if the driver backs off on\n    the pedal just a tad when the twinge is felt, then they are very\n    close to the threshold and they'll probably achieve better\n    stopping distances than if they just punched it and let the ABS\n    take over.\n\n    Recently, there has been a rash of publicity over a number of\n    accidents, and one death, involving police cars equipped with\n    ABS systems.  The police departments in question quickly blamed\n    the new ABS systems, but according to Autoweek magazine, it now\n    seems clear that the problem was a lack of training; none of the\n    involved officers had any recent performance driving training.\n    There is reason to believe that the drivers reacted to the pulsing\n    brake pedal by `pump braking', an old and discredited technique\n    of stabbing and releasing the brake pedal, the goal being to\n    try and get brakes back with a failing hydraulic system.  If you\n    think about it for a minute, you'll realize that pump braking must\n    cut the effective operation of a working brake system by at least\n    1/2, so if you cut the 40% duty cycle of an ABS system by that\n    much, you are giving up most of your brakes for the wrong reason.\n    Threshold braking has the advantage in that it is an effective\n    and useful technique regardless of whether your car has ABS; if\n    you do fear a failed hydraulic system, then one or two stabs at\n    the pedal will be sufficient.    \n\nGas Questions:\n\nQ:  Does High Octane gasoline help?\n\nA:  Maybe, maybe not.  Some cars have knock sensors, and can adjust the\n    engine timing or turbocharger boost to suit the gasoline being used.\n    On most cars, however, you should use the cheapest gas that makes your\n    car run well.  Check your owner's manual for details on what your car\n    needs.\n\nQ:  My car was made for leaded gasoline.  Will unleaded gas hurt it?\n\nA:  It is possible that unleaded gas may *slightly* increase valve wear,\n    although the Amoco Oil company argues otherwise.  The actual increase\n    in valve wear will be almost unnoticeable, however, as modern leaded\n    gasolines actually contain very little lead.  You should, however,\n    check your owner's manual; many cars from the early 1970s do not\n    actually require leaded gasoline.\n\nQ:  Do fuel treatments help?  What kind should I use?\n\nA:  Some do and some don't.  During the winter, it is a good idea to use\n    dry gas; however, some may be harmful to fuel injection systems.\n    Never use an additive containing Methanol (sometimes called Methyl\n    Alcohol); such additives may damage fuel systems in cars with carbs\n    and almost certainly will damage cars with fuel injection.\n\n    Manufacturer's opinions vary on additives containing Ethanol (sometimes\n    called Ethyl Alcohol); if your car has fuel injection, check the owner's\n    manual on your car before  using these.  Most manufacturers consider\n    10% Ethanol acceptable in gasoline.  Additives with Isopropyl Alcohol\n    (Isopropanol), and Petroleum  Distillates are fine in fuel injected\n    cars.\n\n    An occasional bottle of fuel injector cleaner is helpful in cars with\n    fuel injectors, although many premium gasolines contain detergents that\n    do the same job.  Some off brands of fuel injector cleaners contain\n    Ethanol or Methanol; always check the ingredients before putting anything\n    in your gas tank.\n\n    There are a small number of particularly good additives; these are\n    noticeably more expensive that the run-of-the-mill ones, but work\n    much, much better.  Among these are Chevron Techron, Redline SL-1,\n    Wurth `Lubrimoly Ventil Sauber', and BG 44K.  A bottle of one of these,\n    once every six months, is highly recommended.\n\nQ:  What about detergent gasolines?\n\nA:  The quality of detergent packages in gasolines varies somewhat; BMW\n    has instituted a testing program, and gasoline brands which pass this\n    test may advertise that fact.  Stickers indicating passage of the test\n    are now beginning to appear on fuel pumps at gas stations.  If such\n    gasolines are used, then fuel injector cleaners are probably optional.\n    Beforewarned that while use of BMW approved gasolines will keep a clean\n    engine clean, they may not clean a motor with bad valve deposits.\n\nLubrication Questions:\n\nQ:  What do the numbers and letters in a motor oil designation mean?\n\nA:  There are several different items encoded.  There is a two-letter\n    code indicating the type of detergent package that the manufacturer\t\n    uses in the oil; this looks like SE,SF,CD or such.  The S codes are\n    for gasoline engine applications; the C codes are for diesel engine\n    applications.  The second letter is assigned in sequence as new levels\n    of protection are developed; thus SF is considered better than SE,\n    SE is considered better than SD, and so forth.\n\n    The more noticeable designation is the oil weight.  This is either\n    a single number (e.g., 30 weight) or a pair of numbers separated by\n    the letter W (e.g., 10W30.)  The latter type is much more commonly\n    used these days, and are the only type that most automobile\n    manufacturers specify in operators manuals.  The first number in the\n    designation (10W) is the apparent viscosity of the oil when it is cold;\n    the W stands for `winter'.  The second number (30) is the viscosity\n    of the oil when hot.  There is a trick here; the oil doesn't actually\n    get thicker (turn from 10 weight to 30 weight) as it gets hotter.  What\n    is actually happening is that when the oil is cold, it has the viscosity\n    of a cold 10 weight oil.  as it gets hotter, it doesn't get thin as fast\n    as a 10W oil would; by the time it is up to temperature, it has the\n    viscosity of a hot 30 weight oil.\n\n    Note that these numbers actually specify ranges of viscosities; not\n    all 10W oils have exactly the same viscosity when cold, and not all\n    30 weight oils have the same viscosity when hot.  Note also that the\n    novel behaviour of multi-grade oils is caused by additives, and it has\n    been reported that with the sole exception of Castrol GTX, 10W40 oils\n    do not retain their multi-grade characteristics well over time.  10W30,\n    15W40, and 20W50 oils work very well, though.\n\nQ:  Are `quick lube' places any good?\n\nA:  Some do adequate work, but there are quite a few incompetent ones out\n    there.  Let the buyer beware, watch them while they work, make sure\n    that they don't overtorque the oil drain plug, and keep your hand on\n    your wallet at all times.\n\nQ:  Are oil additives like Slick-50 or Tufoil any good?\n\nA:  Slick-50 and Tufoil are PTFE-based additives.  Many of these have\n    come onto the market recently; they are different from the moly-based\n    additives that have been around since the early 50's.  PTFE is the\n    chemical name for Teflon(TM), a trademark owned by DuPont. In general,\n    auto manufacturers do not recommend use of these products.  Most USENET\n    responses to questions on these additives are favorable (slight\n    increase of MPG after application, smoother revving) but long term\n    results (whether PTFE additives are effective after 5K miles) are\n    debatable.  Some manufacturers (such as Saab) claim that either the\n    product or the engine flush that preceeds application causes\n    deterioration of the oil seals and eventual leakage.  Some BMW owners\n    have reported death of valve seals shortly after the addition of\n    Slick 50 to their cars.  This writer has been cautioned by a Slick-50\n    Dealer (!) that Slick-50 should _not_ be used in Japanese motors, as\n    it may clog the oil return passages in the engine.  Otherwise, there are\n    no known reports of damage caused by PTFE additives.\n\n    On the other hand, there are satified Slick 50 customers in the world.\n\nQ:  Do synthetic oils really work?\n\nA:  Yes, but.  More specifically, most auto manufactuers accept synthetics,\n    but disagree with the extremely long oil change intervals claimed by\n    oil manufacturers.  Auto manufacturers recommend that you continue to\n    change oil at the intervals recommended in the owners manual for your\n    car.  Even if you decide to try the longer intervals, at least change\n    the oil filter at regular intervals, as synthetics get just as dirty\n    as conventional oils.\n\n    Synthetic gear lubricants for manual transmissions are another matter\n    entirely; Amsoil, Redline, and AGIP are very highly regarded and very\n    effective.  Mobil 1 synthetic gear lube gets mixed reviews, however.\n\nQ:  Manufacturers are specifying longer and longer oil change intervals.\n    How often should I change my oil?\n\nA:  It depends on how you drive.  If your car always (or nearly always)\n    gets warmed up, and you don't drive it very hard and keep the revs\n    down, the manufacturer's recommendation is probably fine.  If, however,\n    you drive it hard, drive it at high revs, or alternatively, if you\n    only drive it to and from the supermarket so that it doesn't get up\n    to temperature, then you may wish to change oil much more often,\n    perhaps at 3000 mile intervals (given that most manufacturers are\n    now specifying 7500 mile intervals.)  If you don't drive your car\n    much at all (say 7500 miles a year), then you probably want to change\n    oil every six months anyway.  If you are storing a car during the winter,\n    then change oil before storing it and change oil when you bring it out\n    of storage.\n\nMisc. Questions:\n\nQ:  My car has a timing belt.  I hear that bad things happen when they\n    break.  What's the story?\n\nA:  It depends on the internal design of the motor.  Early Ford Escorts,\n    for example, will suffer severe valve damage if the belt breaks, but\n    the newer cars will just require a tow and installation of a new belt.\n    Some Honda motors will not be damaged, but others will be.\n\n    If no replacement interval is specified for your car, then change the\n    belt at least every 60,000 miles; some cars may require more frequent\n    replacement.  Ask your dealer or independent mechanic.  Also, ask if\n    there are any related repairs that should take place at the same time\n    (for example, the same Ford Escorts that suffer valve damage also have\n    a timing belt driven water pump, which has been known to seize,\n    destroying the timing belt, and which then causes major valve damage\n    as a side effect.  Replacing the timing belt while ignoring the water\n    pump can be a costly mistake.)\n\nQ:  Why would anyone be stupid enough to design a motor so that it\n    self destructs when the timing belt breaks?\n\nA:  For performance reasons.  Compromising piston design so that the\n    valves and pistons will not collide requires that the compression\n    ratio of the engine be reduced significantly; this is why you are\n    more likely to avoid valve damage in economy cars than in performance\n    oriented vehicles.\n\nQ:  What causes Unintended Acceleration?\n\nA:  The final report of the National Highway, Transportation, and Safety\n    Administration concluded that unintended acceleration could not be\n    caused by any mechanical failure of the vehicle in question and at the\n    same time be consistent with the physical evidence.  The NHTSA report\n    goes on to conclude that `pedal misapplication' by the vehicle operator\n    is probably the cause.\n-- \nrichard welty        518-393-7228       welty@cabot.balltown.cma.com\n``Nothing good has ever been reported about the full rotation of\n  a race car about either its pitch or roll axis''  -- Carroll Smith\n</td><td>7</td><td>rec.autos</td><td>Archive-name: rec-autos/part5</td><td>[this article is one of a pair of articles containing commonly\nasked automotive questions; the other article contains questions\nmore geared to the automotive enthusiast, and so is not crossposted\nto misc.consumers.  -- rpw]</td><td>318</td></tr><tr><td>From: pp29616@dcl-nextsc.cso.uiuc.edu (Paul Park)\nSubject: Re: Integra GSR (really about other cars)\nArticle-I.D.: news.C51Fs3.37C\nOrganization: University of Illinois at Urbana\nLines: 21\n\nIn article <1993Apr5.212645.15988@nntpd.lkg.dec.com>  \nkenyon@xqzmoi.enet.dec.com (Doug Kenyon (Stardog Champion)) writes:\n> \n> It's great that all these other cars can out-handle, out-corner, and  \nout-\n> accelerate an Integra.\n> \n> But, you've got to ask yourself one question: do all these other cars  \nhave\n> a moonroof with a sliding sunshade?

Drivers are much better disciplined in Europe than they are here.\n\nOh yeah, that would be paradise... in fact, you can forget it. From all I've\nheard from my U.S. relatives, drivers esp. here in Germany are much more agg-\nressive, but not disciplined. One of my relatives, a L.A. resident, hired a car\nat the Nuernberg airport and went about 18 miles to our home. He said then that\nhe grew about 1 year older during this ride and swore he'd never drive a car in\nGermany again (this was in 1982 and he kept his promise - the situation now is\neven worse as effect of the increased volume of traffic).\nWhat you mean by `better disciplined' should perhaps be considered `cautious due\nto fear': \nWhen driving around here, you always *have* to take into consideration that the\nmajority of the other drivers absolutely relies on you: They expect that nobody\nfails or sleeps; many of them exploit this by driving as fast as their car can\ngo (of course only where that is allowed, you might think - dream on :).\nSo any mistake you make is a very high risk to your health - and if you're ex-\nposed to such a situation from your very first day as a driver, you learn to\nhandle it - or you lose... \nThat's the way I and most people I know experience our traffic situation - \nwhether you think this is pleasant or efficient is up to you; I think we handle\na very high volume of traffic and that at high speeds with modest (compared to\nthe volume) and decreasing rates of lethal accidents - OTOH, more and more\npeople (esp. women) dislike driving (because they feel overtaxed and threatened)\nand each accident is one accident too much.\n\n>2. The roads comprising the Autobahn are much better designed than\n>   they are here, and usually include animal fences.  This makes them\n>   far more predictable than most US highways.\n\nBetter designed and maintained, may be - but animal fences are very rare. Auto-\nbahnen and many other streets have guard-rails (I hope that's the right word - \na plank made from thick steel sheet fixed on uprights; it's about 2 feet high);\nthose guard-rails are designed for keeping vehicles on the road. Smaller animals\ncan crawl under the plank, bigger ones can easily jump over it. The point is\nthat esp. larger animals are very rare in Germany; they tend also to be very\ntimid. Accidents caused by animals are a neglegible danger.\n\n>3. Not all of Europe is the Autobahn.

I've got quite a lot of practise (~120k miles) and I'm\nused to travel at 130 mph (FYI, with a car even smaller than a rabbit), but I\nconsider driving on the highways round Paris or Milano really a thrill...\n\n>I strongly suspect you won't find a lot of Rabbit owners doing 120mph\n>(nearly 200km/h) on the Autobahn, but I could be wrong. ...\n\nSorry, but you'll find quite a lot rabbit-class-car (or even smaller, mine is a\nPeugeot 205) owners going that fast; small cars with much HP are very `hip' over\nhere - and most people buying such cars aren't afraid to let them run.\n\n>                                                      ...

Formula-1 cars\nweigh less than 700 kg and the drivers have a chance to survive accidents at\n130 mph or higher - OTOH when crashing against a solid object at 130 mph,\nit makes no difference whether you sit in a Porsche, a Mercedes, a tank or on\na bicycle: Your're dead.\n\nBye,\nStefan\n---\nStefan Dalibor (dalibor@immd3.uni-erlangen.de)\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\"...And now for the next case in Kangaroo Court, I accuse you of being the\nreincarnation of Adolf Hitler.

The greenhouse effect (produced by\n infrared-trapping gasses like CO2 and methane) and the ozone-hole problem\n (produced by long-lived, chlorine-containing molecules) are not the same\n thing.  It is a lot easier to do something about not using the CFC's\n (chloro-fluorocarbons) than it is to stop producing CO2 and methane which\n are natural byproducts of combustion and of living (animal) organisms.\n Planting more trees and not destroying so many existing trees would help\n the greenhouse-gas problem, but would do nothing for the ozone problem.\n\n Fred W.

I have always\n>thought it was the exhaust system and not the engine that produced the noise\n>of a car...?\n\nWell, yes, the exhaust is where the majority of the noise comes out, but the\nbasics (tone, firing cadence, etc.) are determined by the engine configuration.\nIn the case of the Viper, yes, we are discussing a HUGE multicylinder 90-deg.\nengine, which will sound somewhat like a truck.  And my understanding, btw, is\nthat that V-10 engine was designed originally with the intention of being ad-\naptible for either the trucks or the Viper.  And from what I've heard (no first\nhand knowledge :-( ) it's doing a pretty good job at both.\n\nAnd the best exhaust sound in the world is now and will always be a 60-degree\nDOHC Colombo-designed V-12.

My main priorities are a decent horse\npower increase (5-30%) and a nice low note to go along with that added power.\nI was also thinking of looking into both Remus and Leistritz exhausts.Has \nanyone got anything to say about these?

Intentionally blocking a person\nriding your bumper is certainly NOT a \"wise driving practice\", it \nonly causes the jam to become more congested. \n \nI don't mess with trucks and I actually watch the road ahead AND the \nroad behind!   If I perceive that I am rapidly closing on a \"pack\" \nof vehicles, I try to avoid getting caught up in situation such as you \ndecribe.  Usually either traffic is just building and I have to deal \nwith this fact of life, or I wait to a slow passer to complete their \npass and make way for the pack to clear.  If someone decides then to \npull up on my bumper, I signal my intention to move to the right, and \ndo so at the first opportunity (& hope they will open the jam).  I \nfeel this is not only courteous driving, but ALOT safer than the \nactions you advocate!!!  There are actually many courteous drivers \non the road who do not intentionally impede others.  \n\nIf someone in front of me seems to be oblivious to the fact that they \nare blocking traffic I use my blinker or flash my lights, or, if all \nelse fails, will briefly speed up /slow down so they MIGHT get the \nmessage that I am a faster vehicle trying to pass.  I feel it is never \nsafe to ride anyone's bumper.  IF someone is intentionally blocking \ntraffic, because they feel that it is civil duty or philosophic duty \nor for some unfathomable reason, I feel they deserve, at the very least,\nderision.
